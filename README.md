## ü™∂ Chapter Naming Convention

Each chapter file must follow this strict naming pattern:

chapter_##.json

**Examples:**

chapter_01.json
chapter_02.json
chapter_03.json


‚úÖ **Rules**
- Always use **two-digit numbers** (`01‚Äì99`).
- Avoid uppercase letters, spaces, or symbols.
- The `"chapter"` key inside the file **must** match the filename number.
- Each JSON should contain a **valid UTF-8 string**, and **no trailing commas**.

---

## üß† Writing Guidelines

To maintain a consistent narrative and structural format across all chapters, please follow these conventions:

### 1. Dialogues
- Set `"is_dialogue": true` for spoken lines.  
- Each new speaker starts with a new `"id"`.  
- Use `"dialogue_id"` to group multi-line dialogue segments spoken by the same character.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 12,
  "text": "You really think you can win this battle alone?",
  "is_dialogue": true,
  "dialogue_id": 2,
  "is_narrative": false,
  "is_descriptive": false,
  "section_heading": false,
  "section_ref": "scene_forest_conflict"
}
```
### 2. Narration
- Set `"is_narrative": true` for story narration or internal thoughts.  
- Use for transitions, reflections, or storytelling outside of direct dialogue.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "text": "The forest trembled as if the wind itself feared what was coming.",
  "is_dialogue": false,
  "is_narrative": true,
  "is_descriptive": false,
  "section_heading": false,
  "section_ref": "forest_tension"
}
```

### 3. Descriptions
- Set `"is_descriptive": true` for visual, environmental, or emotional tone.  
- Use this for scene-building, setting details, or atmospheric effects.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 18,
  "text": "Dark clouds gathered above, their shadows crawling across the ground like ink.",
  "is_dialogue": false,
  "is_narrative": false,
  "is_descriptive": true,
  "section_heading": false,
  "section_ref": "battle_preparation"
}
```
### 4. Section Headings
- Set `"section_heading": true` to indicate major story divisions, scene changes, or acts.  
- Each heading should include a `"section_ref"` value for internal linking or scripting purposes.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "text": "ACT II ‚Äî Shadows of Resolve",
  "is_dialogue": false,
  "is_narrative": false,
  "is_descriptive": false,
  "section_heading": true,
  "section_ref": "act_2_intro"
}
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder & File Organization

All chapter files are stored inside a single root-level directory called `chapters/`.  
There are **no volume or subfolders** to keep the structure flat and easily accessible.

**Example structure:**
üì¶ repository_root/
‚î£ üìÇ chapters/
‚îÉ ‚î£ üìú chapter_01.json
‚îÉ ‚î£ üìú chapter_02.json
‚îÉ ‚î£ üìú chapter_03.json
‚îÉ ‚îó üìú ...
‚î£ üìú README.md
‚îó üìú LICENSE


- Each JSON file represents **one full chapter**.  
- Filenames must follow the `chapter_##.json` convention.  
- All files should be valid JSON with no trailing commas.


## üßæ Metadata Example

Below is a compact example to illustrate the structure of a chapter JSON file:

```json
{
  "chapter": 1,
  "title": "A Silent Beginning",
  "original_language": "en",
  "full_text": "The wind was still. Nothing moved in the ruins...",
  "paragraphs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "ACT I ‚Äî The Forgotten Dawn",
      "is_dialogue": false,
      "is_narrative": false,
      "is_descriptive": false,
      "section_heading": true,
      "section_ref": "act_1_intro",
      "note": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "The wind was still. Nothing moved in the ruins of the old world.",
      "is_dialogue": false,
      "is_narrative": true,
      "is_descriptive": false,
      "section_heading": false,
      "section_ref": "intro_scene",
      "note": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "\"What is this place?\"",
      "is_dialogue": true,
      "dialogue_id": 1,
      "is_narrative": false,
      "is_descriptive": false,
      "section_heading": false,
      "section_ref": "intro_scene",
      "note": "Esel speaks for the first time"
    }
