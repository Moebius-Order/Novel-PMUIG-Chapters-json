Where’s the headache medicine? I searched the bedside. There must be a favorite Tyrannol. I don’t think it will sink with 2 pills, so I should take about 4 pills.\n\n\nBut nothing is caught.\n\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\n\n[Welcome, Master!]\n\n\n[Internal data is required for execution. Would you like to download it? – It is recommended to use Wi-Fi.]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Downloading… 001/537]\n\n\nIt was a white room.\n\n\nThe top, sides, and bottom are all white.\n\n\nI was lying under the white floor. I got up and looked around. The white space extended beyond the horizon at the end of the field of view.\n\n\nWhere are you?\n\n\nA window with letters written in the upper right corner of my vision came to mind.\n\n\n[Downloading… 004/537]\n\n\n[Tips/Pick Me Up is a hyper roguelike summoning RPG. In fact, it’s more like a simulation than an RPG.]\n\n\nI robbed my seat and got up.\n\n\nThe reason that had been stretched out like wet cotton gradually became clearer.\n\n\nThe space was still white.\n\n\nI was standing on top of that unknown space. Each time the hologram window flickered, the number on the right increased.\n\n\n[Downloading… 009/537]\n\n\n[Tips/The waiting room where heroes gather is called a room.]\n\n\nAs loading progressed, something appeared in the white space.\n\n\ntable. It appeared out of thin air like magic. chair behind. refrigerator. Oven. carpet. Sofa. A wall appeared out of nowhere and blocked everything. The ceiling is also blocked. The plain white floor was neatly finished with metal flooring.\n\n\nThe space gradually began to take the shape of a room.\n\n\n[Downloading… 015/537]\n\n\nWhile staring blankly at the scene, I patted my cheek with both hands.\n\n\nstay calm let’s stay calm\n\n\nEven if you are bitten into a tiger’s den, you will live if you come to your senses.\n\n\nI decided to take a look back at it. why did you come here Slowly think about what you did yesterday.\n\n\n“Now, what did you do yesterday, Han Seo-jin?”\n\n\nI woke up, washed up and had breakfast.\n\n\nAs usual, I turned on my computer and uploaded a strategy video to Mutube. Next, I bought dinner at a convenience store and returned home. What happened before you came back? Did you drink at all? no. It’s been a long time since I stopped drinking.\n\n\n‘Come back home and change the battery…’\n\n\nAdvent Dungeon.\n\n\nWith the 100 million DL breakthrough event, the advent dungeon of transcendental difficulty was opened.\n\n\nI sent an advance party, and the advance party was annihilated in a spectacular way. Just as I was about to think of the next move…\n\n\n‘There was a bug.’\n\n\nIt was an unheard of bug.\n\n\nThe graphics and text are all crushed, and the boss level is something like 999. Considering that the level limit for heroes excluding 7 stars is 99, this is a ridiculous number. When I tried to return to the main screen after being wiped out, my phone froze.\n\n\nwhat did you do next I pressed the power button on my phone and\n\n\nthe memory ended there.\n\n\n[Downloading… 045/537]\n\n\nDid you fall asleep?\n\n\nWas I that tired?\n\n\nI tilted my head.\n\n\nAs a result of thinking for a while, I concluded that this place was a dream.\n\n\nI fell asleep on the sofa and it seems like I’m dreaming. Moreover, it is a lucid dream in which you are aware that it is a dream that is not a normal dream.\n\n\nBut I’m not the type to dream often.\n\n\nI couldn’t even remember the last time I had a dream.\n\n\n[Downloading… 055/537]\n\n\nThe interior of the white room is ready.\n\n\nThe empty room was being decorated. However, the furniture was all made of metal, and the color was either gray or pure white.\n\n\nIt wasn’t to my liking.\n\n\nIt has a modern atmosphere, but it doesn’t seem like people live there.\n\n\n“Is there anyone out there!”\n\n\nI cried out once.\n\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\nThat’s great. I thought only dreams of dark history or ghosts were nightmares.\n\n\nI opened the door I came across and walked out of the room.\n\n\nWhen I left the room, it was a square. It is as big and wide as the school playground, but it is an indoor plaza, not an outdoor one. A high wall was built at the end of the plaza.\n\n\nAbove, instead of the ceiling, there was a hazy sky.\n\n\n“Is anyone there? Answer me if there is, please!”\n\n\nI cried out loud.\n\n\nAlso no answer\n\n\n“What kind of dog dream is this?”\n\n\nThe reality is pretty good for a dream subject.\n\n\nCool air on your skin. The sound of your shoes hitting the floor. vivid colors. All senses were clearly felt. So it made me feel even worse.\n\n\nAn iron gate sits on the sagging wall of the plaza.\n\n\nThe door was closed, and above it was a nameplate that read ‘The gap in time and space’. There was not one door. There were gates of the same shape erected all over the wall.\n\n\nI walked slowly through the plaza and inspected the nameplates on each door.\n\n\nI grabbed the doorknob of the armory\n\n\nand shook it, but it only rattled and did not open.\n\n\n“What kind of dreams do you have?”\n\n\nI tried opening other doors, but the same thing.\n\n\nEventually I went back to my original room. There were no more objects in the room, but the letters in the air were still being updated.\n\n\nI opened the refrigerator.\n\n\nThe refrigerator was full of orange juice. I took out the juice from the bottom compartment and poured it into a cup.\n\n\n[Downloading… 362/537]\n\n\n[Tips/Great reward for completing the tutorial.]\n\n\nI laid my back on the sofa.\n\n\nA soft feeling permeated his back. The orange juice that went down my throat was refreshing.\n\n\nI pinched my cheek.\n\n\nIt hurt.\n\n\nCome to think of it, when I tapped both cheeks to try to come to my senses, it hurt quite, no, really.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nWhat is this.\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\nThis must be a dream place. The orange juice I drink, the comfort of the sofa, and the pain in my cheek are all dreams.\n\n\nAs I thought of that, a whisper came to my mind.\n\n\n‘What if it’s not a dream?’\n\n\nIt was a surprisingly cold voice.\n\n\nI shook my head to erase the mocking voice from my ears.\n\n\n[Downloading… 511/537]\n\n\n[Tips/Level up your hero with synthesis.]\n\n\n“Should I slow down the game a bit?”\n\n\nI looked at the window floating in one corner of my field of vision.\n\n\nIt was not a very familiar window. this font. these tips. this number. This is the screen that appears when you install Pick Me Up for the first time.\n\n\nWhen the download is over, do you wake up from a dream?\n\n\nI feel dirty. It was a dream I never wanted to have again.\n\n\nbe over soon I don’t want to be here even for a moment.\n\n\n[Downloading… 537/537 : Done!]\n\n\nA window popped up in the center of the room and a video was played.\n\n\n[Taoni, the land where humans and heterogeneous people live together.]\n\n\n[An unidentified enemy invades the continent that used to be peaceful and prosperous!]\n\n\nCrude 2D graphics.\n\n\nburning castle.\n\n\nA soldier who looks like a paper doll and a monster collide.\n\n\n[Eventually, the continent is torn apart by the power of darkness.]\n\n\n[But there is still hope.]\n\n\n[You Master! Climb the tower if you want to save the world!]\n\n\n[Many heroes will be with you.]\n\n\nThe video was closed.\n\n\nI was watching with my mouth open.\n\n\n[I am Isel, a fairy of beginnings who will help Master for the time being. Please tell me the master’s name first!]\n\n\n[Cannot use spaces between 2 and 6 characters]\n\n\n[Pick-up]\n\n\n[This name already exists.]\n\n\nI’m not using it.\n\n\nThe keyboard entered randomly, and then the letters were engraved.\n\n\n[My first name]\n\n\n[This name already exists.]\n\n\n[Kanada]\n\n\n[This name already exists.]\n\n\n[Amkena]\n\n\n[This name can be used. Do you want to use it?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Welcome to the world of Pick Me Up, Amkena!]\n\n\n[Do you want to proceed with the tutorial? Upon completion, a certain reward is given.]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nThe choice is arbitrary.\n\n\nWhen the white cursor clicked ‘Yes’, the field of view flipped.\n\n\nLight shone in front of my eyes.\n\n\nI didn’t even have time to think.\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, it was a burning town.\n\n\n[At the time of the 351st year of the Imperial Era, the army of demons invades the continent.]\n\n\n[There was a boy named ‘Han Israt’ in a small village in the Heim region.]\n\n\nAcrid smoke stimulates the nose.\n\n\n“Coke, Coke!”\n\n\nI coughed while bending over.\n\n\nThe inside of my throat is burning hot.\n\n\n‘Where is this again…’\n\n\nFlames are rising from all sides.\n\n\nWhat was burning was a private house. The modestly built house and the wood in the fenced barn were engulfed in flames and burned fiercely.\n\n\nTo the side, people are slipping away like the ebb tide.\n\n\n“It’s a goblin!”\n\n\n“Don’t come, don’t come!”\n\n\n“This way! We have to hurry!”\n\n\nI laughed out loud.\n\n\nIn his right hand was a worn-out iron sword.\n\n\n[Tutorial Quest 1. Defeat the goblins that invaded the village!]\n\n\n[The battle proceeds automatically. Enjoy high-level battles implemented by the hero’s internal AI!]\n\n\n“Keruk, Kerruk!”\n\n\nFar below the hills, green-skinned monsters were swarming.\n\n\nHe is about 150 cm tall. He is wearing a helmet and holding a curved sword. He was bent at the waist, and his green skin was disfigured.\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.1]\n\n\n“What are those monsters?”\n\n\nThe goblins were slaughtering the people down the hill. Both men and women swung their swords and slaughtered them. With the torch in his left hand, he set the house on fire.\n\n\nIt was hell too.\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ feels fear! All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\n[Tips/Heroes sometimes panic.]\n\n\nHero Han?\n\n\nSounds like a dog clapping!\n\n\nI don’t know where, but I have to run away. I climbed the hill If people go in the direction they run away, somehow it will work.\n\n\nTung.\n\n\nNo matter how many steps he climbed, his body stopped as if he had bumped into a wall.\n\n\n“Why aren’t you leaving?”\n\n\nPeople around me pass by unscathed.\n\n\nI stretched out my hand into the air. A strong sense of resistance clung to my fingertips.\n\n\n“This, like a dog!”\n\n\nI did a body slap with all my might. A sharp pain radiated through my shoulder, and I fell to the floor.\n\n\njump up\n\n\n“Then go aside!”\n\n\nTung.\n\n\nThere was also a transparent wall next to it.\n\n\nI pushed with all my might, but it didn’t move an inch.\n\n\nIn the end, unstoppable.\n\n\n“What are you!”\n\n\nI shouted at the refugees passing by.\n\n\n“Where are you! Can you hear me? Answer me!”\n\n\nPeople just ran away as if they hadn’t heard or not heard.\n\n\nI tried to grab the shoulder of the man who had just jumped over the fence, but the transparent wall blocked my hand again.\n\n\nGoblins were approaching from down the hill.\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ panics! All stats are reduced by 50%.]\n\n\n[Master, use the anti-fear potion on heroes in crisis! You can buy the anti-fear potion for 50 gems, and this opportunity is provided for free.]\n\n\n[Do you want to use it?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional)/No]\n\n\nA purple bottle appeared out of nowhere.\n\n\nThe bottle cap popped open and landed on his face.\n\n\n“Ugh!”\n\n\nI sat down with my hands on the ground.\n\n\nA bitter, poisonous liquid entered the airways.\n\n\n“Cough, Cough Cough!”\n\n\nIt’s like putting pepper on your nose.\n\n\nIf you’re going to feed it, feed it finely!\n\n\nAt the same time, the nape of the back sank coldly. The throbbing vision became clearer. It was as if cold water had been splashed on my overcooked head.\n\n\nThe first thing that came out was\n\n\n“Fuck…”",
