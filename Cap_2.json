Found\n\n\nI opened the front door.\n\n\nThe cold air seeped into his nose.\n\n\n‘Why is it colder inside than outside?’\n\n\nChicken meat sprouted from the chill.\n\n\nI brushed the snow off my shoulders and head and put on my slippers. I put the bag containing the hamburger lunch box and cider I bought from 8-Eleven on the sofa. Turn on the boiler with the remote control placed on the shoe rack at the entrance and dive as if collapsing on a two-person sofa.\n\n\nRemove the battery from the charging stand.\n\n\nI opened the phone case, replaced the battery and turned on the power. The screen lit up white. Enter Windows after fingerprint recognition. I touched the app in the center.\n\n\nIt’s a mobile game that was released two years ago. The developer is Mobius.\n\n\nTwo years later, Pick Me Up has become a popular game with nearly 100 million downloads worldwide.\n\n\nLoading popped up and I was connected to the main screen.\n\n\n[Welcome to Pick Me Up!]\n\n\n[TOUCH!]\n\n\nTouch the main screen.\n\n\nThe familiar scene of the waiting room greeted me.\n\n\nIn the office in the waiting room, a blonde haired female knight was sitting quietly.\n\n\nSix-star Grand Knight Siris. As the leader of the main raid party, he was a 4-star super rare character that I picked for the first and last time.\n\n\nHe recalled the time he summoned Siris.\n\n\nAt the time, I was quite angry, but the reason was that I poured 500, but I didn’t even get 4 stars, let alone 5 stars. It’s not five hundred won. It was five million won. That’s why I even cried when the fanfare rang for the first time. Thanks to that, I raised both gold and jade, and distributed all the good ingredients.\n\n\nAfterwards, as I fell in love with the game, I realized that there was no message between 500 or so, but that will be for later.\n\n\nWhen you touch Siris, an illustration appears.\n\n\nShe was a green-eyed beauty with blonde hair.\n\n\nA hearty laugh comes out of nowhere. Although he was not a 5-star ultra-rare at birth, he has become a special hero who can never be beaten by most 6-star characters.\n\n\nI closed the illustration by pressing the ‘X’ in the upper right corner and looked at the other heroes who were blushing in each facility in the waiting room.\n\n\nFirst of all, the heroes who are rolling hard at the training center. Most of them are 1 or 2 stars obtained through free draws. Among them, it is said that there is a very low probability that a jackpot that surpasses the original 5 stars will be born, but almost all of them end in failure. I did too.\n\n\nEven in the world of mobile games, gold spoons and dirt spoons are divided.\n\n\nHeroes of less than 3 stars at birth will disappear as synthetic materials for advanced heroes. Since the percentage of high-level heroes of 4 stars or higher is extremely low, I raise them by crying and eating mustard, but that’s the average.\n\n\nSecond, the heroes who successfully completed the training process. It’s a shame to use it as a main force in small missions with less than 5 people, but it’s worth participating in large parties or special missions.\n\n\nLastly, the main forces that I cherished.\n\n\nAmong the many heroes, only the promising ones were selected and selected, and now they are all 6-star levels, and a week ago, they broke the 88th floor for the first time in Korea. They are heroes who will not be defeated no matter where they are presented.\n\n\nA game that does not roll only with skills that can be seen only by the ability values in the status window.\n\n\nI recalled the hardships of becoming 5th in the world rankings.\n\n\n‘It was like a dog.’\n\n\nVery dog-like really.\n\n\nThe subtitle of Pick Me Up is a hyper roguelike summoning RPG, or roguelike.\n\n\nIt means luck X ruined game.\n\n\nDrawing is also luck, but ability is also luck, battle is also luck.\n\n\nEven if you can give basic instructions, the battle ends with the heroes whining on their own. They know when and how to use their skills. For unknown reasons, there are many cases of being unable to fight.\n\n\nAs memories of that time came to mind, the hand holding the cell phone became tense.\n\n\n‘No way.’\n\n\nIt’s just the old days when I didn’t know anything about Pick Me Up.\n\n\nThere are clearly areas that can be covered by operation or know-how.\n\n\nI was a living witness.\n\n\nI was an unlucky bastard.\n\n\nI’ve played paid draws over thousands of times, but I’ve never seen a 5-star hero that rankers below the top 100 in the world say there are dogs or cows. To be honest, there are hardly any 4 stars, let alone 5 stars. If there is, there is only one Siris. Even if the 5-star probability is 0.1% and the 4-star probability is less than 1%, isn’t it too much?\n\n\nHowever, if Pick Me Up was a game where only the star rating was determined by pure luck, I would not have been ranked as a ranker. Skill can overcome luck. It was also the biggest factor that got me into Pick Me Up.\n\n\nToday is Friday. Check the status of the waiting room and issue instructions to the heroes. The number of heroes has increased so much that it is almost impossible to control them individually.\n\n\nAnd check the notice.\n\n\n[Pick Me Up surpassed 100 million DL!]\n\n\n[Thanks to the enthusiastic support of masters around the world, the total number of downloads of Pick Me Up has exceeded 100 million! We will hold a special event accordingly. For details, check below.]\n\n\nIt’s over 100 million before I knew it.\n\n\n‘Open Advent Dungeon!’\n\n\nGems and gold aren’t bad, but they’re affordable. Now that the operation is on track, it overflows. I don’t even want a summons. Even if I pull it out, it doesn’t come out, so what?\n\n\nWhat I need is a hero awakening!\n\n\nA chance to get a 7-star hero called the dream grade!\n\n\nI looked at the announcement with a trembling heart.\n\n\n[Event Details]\n\n\n[1. 100 gems will be distributed every day from January 27th to February 5th, 20XX. A chance to get a total of 1000 gems! However, compensation will not be paid if you are not logged in.]\n\n\n[2. All connected Masters will receive 1 Advanced Hero Summon Ticket. The fact that advanced summon tickets are summoned at least 3 stars!]\n\n\n[3. Event last! The Transcendental Advent Dungeon is open.]\n\n\nWhen I checked the third event, I let out a scream of joy.\n\n\nIt was an advent dungeon of transcendental difficulty that opened in three months.\n\n\nSelect ‘Gap of Construction’ at the bottom left of the main waiting room menu. As the blue summoning text expanded, the list of dungeons was listed.\n\n\n[Climb the tower and save the world!]\n\n\n[Main dungeon: Current number\n\n\nof floors to climb – 88] [Dungeon feast that changes every day!]\n\n\n[Dungeon of the week: Isralta mine (advanced – 5 hours)]\n\n\n[Collect various rare materials !]\n\n\n[Exploration Dungeon: Exploring Saints (remaining time 17 hours 35 seconds)]\n\n\n[Prove your strength!]\n\n\n[Advent Dungeon: Difficulty – Superb]\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nAdvent dungeon of transcendental difficulty was open.\n\n\nI swallowed my saliva. There was a mixture of joy, excitement and tension.\n\n\n‘The Book of Reverse Heaven.’\n\n\nA key material to become a 7 star hero.\n\n\nOther materials were obtained a long time ago.\n\n\nIf you only learn the Book of Reversal, which drops with a very low probability in the Special Advent Dungeon, you can create a 7-star hero that is said to be less than 5 in the world. It is possible to aim for world number 1 instead of 5th place.\n\n\nI opened the hero box and looked at the heroes.\n\n\nThere is a party made up of heroes who can understand the pattern of the boss, but who won’t lose much if they disappear. Their abilities are useful, but they interfere with the operation of the waiting room.\n\n\nTheir role is the advance team.\n\n\nPick Me Up adopts an atrocious system that disappears when a hero dies.\n\n\nHardcore by name.\n\n\nA hero who spent hundreds of hours making tens of millions of won through a single mistake or luck is gone. Some people curse at who plays this game, but I, no, pick me up maniacs, including me, don’t care at all.\n\n\nSo it was fun.\n\n\nIt’s a mobile game, but it’s a thrill that’s close to reality.\n\n\nIf infinite challenge is possible, a roguelike will not work.\n\n\nThe tension of not knowing when and where to die. The satisfaction of watching the battles performed by the internal artificial intelligence unique to each hero. The joy of a hero growing up and the frustration of dying. The feeling of freedom when clearing a floor.\n\n\nIt was the essence of Pick Me Up.\n\n\nI dispatched a temporary party to Advent Dungeon.\n\n\nYou never know which boss will come out.\n\n\nWhat level are you, monster type, human type, what type of skill you use.\n\n\nThe advance team will analyze the pattern of the boss and oxidize fiercely.\n\n\n[Drunk!]\n\n\n[Advent dungeon opens!]\n\n\n[Warning! Warning! Warning!]\n\n\nA red message announcing the appearance of a powerful enemy appeared on the screen.\n\n\nField type is dark. According to the Pick Me Up setting, it is a ‘super-dimensional space’. It was just an uncommon map with pitch-black darkness. Even I, who have cleared the dungeon thousands of times, have seen the Dark Field on one hand.\n\n\nAs it is an Advent Dungeon, I entered the boss battle immediately without any progress.\n\n\nHowever, as soon as I entered, a message appeared on the right side of the screen informing me of the hero’s status change.\n\n\n[‘Diora (★★★★★★)’ is afraid! All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Nicholas (★★★★★)’ feels fear! All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Gent (★★★★★)’ feels fear! All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Akelta (★★★★★)’ feels fear! All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Melky (★★★★★)’ feels fear! All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\n‘These bastards?’\n\n\nThe boss hasn’t even appeared yet.\n\n\nEventually, Diora, the party leader and main tank, printed out a proposal.\n\n\n[The leader of ’38 Party’, Diora (★★★★★★), suggests retreating. Do you accept?]\n\n\n[Yes / No (optional)]\n\n\nI pressed ‘No’ without hesitating for a second.\n\n\n[‘Diora (★★★★★★)’ panics! All stats are 50%…]\n\n\n[‘Nicholas (★★★★★)’ is…]\n\n\n[‘Gent (★★★★★)’ is…]\n\n\n‘How are you?’\n\n\nNo matter how much you throw away words, five stars and six leaders. The level was also raised to the limit. Those guys panicked. Panic is a state abnormality that newly summoned heroes only see in their first battle.\n\n\nThen, one conclusion.\n\n\n‘He’s a guy with horror abilities.’\n\n\nConclusions were drawn quickly. A list of items and skills that increase fear resistance were listed in my mind.\n\n\nIf you don’t care about this, you may have to make a 2nd advance party.\n\n\nSoon after, the boss appeared with a dynamic sound.\n\n\nThe boss’s name popped up at the top of the screen.\n\n\n[SS▩SH黑⊙∈※ Lv.999]\n\n\n“What is this?”\n\n\nWhat’s your name? is it a bug?\n\n\nThe appearance is even more spectacle. I can understand that it is a small humanoid, but the entire thing is mosaic-processed. All you can see is the minimal form. I couldn’t make out the rest.\n\n\n[‘Diora (★★★★★★)’ falls into despair! All stats are 80%…]\n\n\n[‘Nicholas (★★★★★)’ is…]\n\n\n[‘Gent (★★★★★)’ is…]\n\n\nA dejected laugh flowed.\n\n\nwhat’s the level again? 999? This is an obvious system error.\n\n\nI’ll live and live and see all the bugs in Pick Me Up.\n\n\nNo bugs have been reported except for a few pranks until now, two years after opening.\n\n\nI pressed the camera button to take a picture and waited for the end of the advance team. I want to do something about it, but once I’m in battle, I can’t go back.\n\n\nThe battle has begun.\n\n\nI used a few potions to remove abnormal conditions bought with gems, but the despair was not resolved.\n\n\nAn 80% reduction. In a very sluggish movement, Diora stepped forward with her shield up. Dealer Nicolas and Gent are in the middle, and supporters Akelta and Melki are in the back.\n\n\nIt is a standard formation.\n\n\nAnd the boss moved in the dark purple colored field.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nIt was a massacre.\n\n\nDiora died without even trying to resist. Even though he had the battle continuation skill, he didn’t even have a ‘moribund’ state before death.\n\n\nBecause of the mosaic covering the boss, it was impossible to know which skill to use. It just squirmed closer, leaving only a corpse behind.\n\n\n[‘Diora (★★★★★★)’ returned to the arms of the goddess. Her fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n[‘Nicholas (★★★★★)’ is…]\n\n\n[‘Gent (★★★★★)’ is…] ‘\n\n\nRising in the center of the screen’ The seven letters of ‘You Lose’.\n\n\nI couldn’t hold on for 10 seconds and the max level party, including 6 stars, was wiped out.\n\n\n“Damn it.”\n\n\nI knew I would die. It was sent as expected. But is this the harvest you got? Do you know how long it takes to get five stars?\n\n\nYou have to see the minimum balak instrument to get a quote!\n\n\n“Like a dog, lucky X man!”\n\n\nIs there a bug that pops up there!\n\n\nNo matter how much I yell at the customer center, they won’t fix it. A hero once lost can never be restored for any reason.\n\n\nI just hit the screen and hit it repeatedly.\n\n\nUh, but…\n\n\n“Why don’t you go over?”\n\n\nThe screen does not jump to the waiting room.\n\n\n‘You Lose’ still floating with the boss looking at the center of the screen.\n\n\n“What’s with all these fucking bugs?”\n\n\nI pressed the power button on the right side of my phone.\n\n\nIf this is a bug, it is not a customer center, but a phone complaint.\n\n\nMy phone was forced shut down and I waited for a reboot.\n\n\n“…crazy.”\n\n\ndoes not turn off\n\n\nThe power didn’t turn off. ‘You Lose’ still pops up. The boss at the back of the field looked at me through the screen.\n\n\nThe part of the boss’ mouth that was crushed into a mosaic seemed to be whispering something.\n\n\n「I found it.」\n\n\nThen, my consciousness fell.",
