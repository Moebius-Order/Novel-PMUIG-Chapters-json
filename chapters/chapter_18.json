In other words, it meant accessing three times a day in Earth time. There were days when I would close the connection without doing anything, and I would roll the ‘1st party’ that Jenna and Aaron belonged to on the lower floor, and sometimes I would send a sub-party that had just been weeded out.\n\nIn the second 10-year draw, Blacksmith and Tanner were obtained, and the equipment workshop was also started.\n\nThe first blacksmith chosen was me.\n\nThe reason was simple. It’s because I made a C-rank weapon with the lowest grade materials. I don’t have a blacksmith skill, but Amkena took notice of me and brought me to the blacksmith’s shop. In a catastrophic failure, the ingredients were blown away about ten times, and the person who was supposed to enter was normally placed.\n\nThe manufacturing method was automatic production.\n\nIt was a way to entrust the production entirely to the hands of the craftsman without manipulation by the master. Fortunately, the new blacksmith knew how to make weapons. Blacksmiths and tanners and carpenters began working together to make equipment.\n\nThe equipment mainly made was a crude E-rank sword and wooden shield. This was distributed among the newly arrived heroes. The survival rate of new recruits has increased significantly.\n\nThe main party was given more luxurious equipment.\n\nAaron and I were given E-rank leather armor, and Jenna was given a dagger for self-defense as a secondary weapon. The quality wasn’t great, but it was better than walking around naked, so I decided to use it.\n\nAfter being misunderstood by Amkena, I had no intention of making any more equipment. If you make it, it’s next to find a way to fool the Master’s eyes.\n\nAnd the three who did not perform well were disposed of as synthetics. They were looking for an exit, saying they would run away on an imaginary day without showing up at the training ground. Among them was Dolph, who cheated on his job the first day he came here.\n\nThe synthesis target, ‘1 party’, each rose by one level.\n\nI am level 8, Jenna is level 6, and Aaron is level 4.\n\n[Han Israat ( ) Lv. 8(Exp 24/60)]\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n[Strength: 20/20]\n\n[Intelligence: 12/12]\n\n[Stamina: 20/20]\n\n[Agility: 20/20]\n\n[Possessed Skill: Lesser Swordsman Alcohol (Lv.4) Pain Resistance (Lv.1) Calmness (Lv.1)]\n\nInstead of falling intelligence, strength and stamina are increasing.\n\nIt’s an even growth trend that doesn’t have any particular stats.\n\nIt was fortunate that the intelligence stat didn’t seem to affect the actual intelligence. Because I don’t want to be stupid.\n\n[Form a party.]\n\n[Drag and drop heroes!]\n\n[‘Gide( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n[‘Hansson( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\nFinally, the trio of boys Two of them joined the main party.\n\nWith this, party 1 filled all the allowed seats. Amkena opened a gap in time and space, as if she wanted to roll it straight away.\n\n“i look forward to!”\n\n“Relax.”\n\nAaron tapped Gide and Hanson on the shoulder.\n\nI smiled. how big was it\n\n“It’s going to be a harpy again, right?”\n\n“yes.”\n\n“I’m kind of tired of this.”\n\nJenna yawned with a bored expression.\n\nOnce you clear that floor, the mission remains the same even if you try again. We already had a record of facing harpies and goblins more than three times.\n\n[Floor 4.]\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n[Goal – Exterminate the enemy!]\n\n[Goblin Lv.4 X 3]\n\n[Harpy Lv.6 X 2]\n\nSame place.\n\nIt was the same monster.\n\nThe goblins and harpies who spotted us lit up their eyes.\n\nAaron stood behind me, a few steps away, and a few steps further behind me, Jenna with an arrow in her bow.\n\nGide and Hansson stepped up on either side of me.\n\nTheir main weapons were swords and shields.\n\n“Don’t panic. Stay in formation.”\n\n“yes!”\n\nThe two answered with a firm expression.\n\nOkay, no fear status ailments. He must have rolled downstairs before joining us, so he’s not a newbie in real life.\n\n“You guys are shields. There is no need to force an attack. There is a spear and a bow behind you.”\n\n“I’ll keep that in mind!”\n\nThe weak have their own way of fighting.\n\nit was true To increase the power of groups rather than individuals.\n\nIn the future, if the level and stars rise and the promotion is repeated, it will rise to the realm of the superman, but it was not now.\n\nI don’t go to battle\n\nTo be honest, I can clear this stage by myself. I actually tried to do that too. But if I go out, it won’t be a formation practice.\n\nYou don’t know what missions will come up on the 5th floor. Among them, there were definitely missions that I couldn’t do alone.\n\n“Kiaaa!”\n\nTwo harpies charged from both sides.\n\nJenna didn’t strike preemptively either. As if trying to watch the two of them, they were standing by and holding on to their protests.\n\n“Aww!”\n\nGide and Hanson started fighting back.\n\nHe swung his sword while covering vital parts of his body with his shield. The sword attack has quite sharp momentum. Gide’s sword cut deep into the harpy’s wings.\n\nAt that moment, Aaron’s stab cut through the gap.\n\nThe harpy died screaming with a spear driven deep into his chest.\n\n“Keeck!”\n\nJenna’s arrow hit the goblin’s forehead as it tried to attack Hanson.\n\nThe two kept their guard tight and focused on defense and counterattack, and Aaron’s stab and Jenna’s arrow penetrated the gap.\n\n‘It seems to have caught on to some extent.’\n\nThe trick of Geun Joong-Won is being displayed.\n\nThis is more than enough for an individual’s combat power. Three goblins and two harpies met their deaths without being able to fight back properly.\n\n[Stage cleared!]\n\n[‘Gide( )’ ‘Hanson( )’ level up!]\n\n[Reward – 2000G iron ore (C) X 2 leather (C) X 1]\n\n[MVP – ‘Jenna ( )’]\n\nLight shines through the forest wrapped up\n\nWe returned to the gap in time and space.\n\n“Good!”\n\nGide and Hanson held hands brightly.\n\nWhen I came out, Dika, the last member of the trio, was waiting for me. Dika, who was walking back and forth in the plaza and showed an uneasy look, ran as fast as she could when the space-time gap opened.\n\n“how was it?”\n\n“How about it, Bob!”\n\nGide said with a smile.\n\nAfter bowing to me, the three walked into the dorm with arms around their shoulders.\n\nAmkena formed the main party with 5 people.\n\nThis means that the time to challenge the 5th floor is not far away. I expected to put 3 stars in, but I don’t think so yet.\n\nA few more days passed.\n\nGide and Hanson looked confident. I enthusiastically participated in training and got used to forming formations. Now, even if me and Jenna let go, I managed to take down the harpies and goblins.\n\n“Today is also the 4th floor. I want to go to the next floor now.”\n\nGide touched the scarred shield and said.\n\nThe gap in space-time is open. We were waiting near the mirror as usual. Not only me and Jenna, but also Aaron Gide and Hanson have room in their posture.\n\n“Isel.”\n\n[Yes.]\n\n“Today, the 5th floor, right?”\n\n[Probably!]\n\n“Oh, is it really on the 5th floor?”\n\nJenna blinked.\n\nThe mirror on the left was slowly shining.\n\nI waited for the battle to come.\n\nIt is true that the difficulty is higher than the other floors, but it is easy to clear except for a few trap missions. I knew all the tricks.\n\n“This time it will be a little different. It’s good to loosen up, but if it loosens up too much, your neck will fly.”\n\n“I’ll keep that in mind!”\n\nOne answer is loud.\n\n[Climb the tower and save the world!]\n\n[Main Dungeon: Current number of floors to climb – 4]\n\nI entrusted myself to the light that enveloped my whole body.\n\nAnd when I opened my eyes again, we were in an unfamiliar space.\n\nThe field was an urban area. Buildings made of stone make up the city.\n\nIt is not the modern way to build with cement and concrete. Brick roads and a tall bell tower in the center of the city stood out.\n\nI looked around.\n\nNo message informing of the contents of the mission appeared. There is a grace period before it starts.\n\n“Brother, there are no monsters…”\n\n“I know.”\n\nUntil now, as soon as it was summoned, it was placed in a confrontation with the enemy right in front of it. But not now. The city was empty, and there were no monsters to fight, not even its citizens.\n\n‘It’s not a subjugation mission.’\n\nI clicked my tongue.\n\nI thought it would come out one day.\n\n“Attention! First, go to the center of the city and examine the situation. Line up!”\n\nThe party members quickly dispersed as they had trained and formed a search formation.\n\nLarge ones line up. I’m in the lead, Aaron and Jenna are the second lieutenants, Gide and Hanson are the second.\n\n“If you find anything suspicious, report it immediately.”\n\n“yes!”\n\nWe slowly make our way to the center of the city.\n\nIf you look back, you can see the low outer wall surrounding the city, so you don’t have to worry about losing your direction.\n\nAs we went on, more and more strange things were revealed.\n\n“…”\n\nGide swallowed with an anxious expression.\n\nFirst of all, the condition of the building is not a word. It was the placenta that was broken or smashed. In some cases, they had to turn around because of building debris, such as bricks or pieces of wood, blocking the main street.\n\nSecond, there are no people.\n\nThe uninhabited city itself gave off a dreary atmosphere.\n\nAnd the third time…\n\n“Ughhhhhhhhhh!”\n\n“what?”\n\n“Tongue, brother, here, here hee hee!”\n\nI approached the flustered Hanson.\n\nHanson shuddered, pointing into the ruined walls of the building. Looking closely, I saw a whitish human figure.\n\nIt was a human skeleton.\n\nI stepped into the building.\n\nno i didn’t want to move However, a transparent wall informing that entry is prohibited blocked the way.\n\n“…”\n\n“Hey, where is this place, what the hell? There are buildings, but there are no people…”\n\nWhenever they showed a confident appearance, Gide and Hansson looked anxious.\n\n“let’s go.”\n\nThe boulevard stretched towards the center of the city.\n\nSuddenly I noticed a dark brown stain near the wall. It was hard to recognize because it dried up as soon as it dried up, but I was able to figure out what the prototype was.\n\n‘It’s a bloodstain.’\n\nBuildings became increasingly dilapidated toward the center of the city. Remnants of destroyed buildings and human remains were scattered everywhere.\n\nThis was a ruined city.\n\nWhen we arrived at the plaza in the center of the city,\n\nthe situation was the same here. All over the place collapsed, and monsters and people were nowhere to be seen. Once I ordered a wait. Everyone sat down in their seats. Jenna came over.\n\n“It’s completely different from anything we’ve done before.”\n\n“It was a warm-up.”\n\nThe boss stage on each floor is different in scale and complexity from other floors.\n\n“When will the enemy appear?”\n\n“wait. I’m thinking about it.”\n\nA remote city with no enemies or allies.\n\nBloodstains and remains everywhere.\n\nMission notification message still not appearing. I\n\nhave a conclusion.\n\nI pointed to the half-collapsed bell tower and said,\n\n“Jenna, can you climb this bell tower? ”\n\n“What can I do?”\n\n“Climb as high as you can and see what’s there.”\n\n“Old write!”\n\nJenna began to climb the bell tower\n\nin a nimble manner. “First of all, I think we’ve come this far!”\n\nJenna\n\nsaid from up there. ”\n\nWhat do you see\n\n? ”\n\n“The city?”\n\n“…”\n\nJenna’s expression stiffened.\n\n” What the hell is there\n\n,\n\nMs. Jenna!”\n\nAaron shouted from below, frustrated\n\n. , that is, with the city. I hope I’m wrong.”\n\n“I’m not mistaken.”\n\n“Now, wait a minute. is this okay? Can I do this?”\n\n“Oh, tell me!”\n\n“There are a lot of goblins outside the city. It looks like it’s coming here.”\n\n“How long do you want it to be? ten? twenty? A hundred?”\n\n“…thousands.”\n\n“What, what did you say?”\n\n“Thousands of goblins…coming here.”\n\n[Warning!]\n\n[Floor 5.]\n\n[Mission Type – Survival]\n\n[Goal – Survive from the incoming enemies!]\n\n[Goblin Lv.?
