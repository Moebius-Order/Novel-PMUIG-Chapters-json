If you want to live, get on the line well (2)\n\n\nThe three of them were watching us like other people.\n\n\nThe number of equipment displayed in the arsenal has been drastically reduced. There were only 2 left. bow and shield. It’s because all the guys who took it out died. In Pick Me Up, when the hero dies, the equipment he is holding also disappears.\n\n\nJenna took out her bow and quiver and held it against her back. I secured the leather straps on the back of the wooden shield to my wrists.\n\n\nAs soon as I put on my equipment and came out of the armory, the door was closed.\n\n\nIsel appeared and pointed at us.\n\n\n[Han Jenna Aaron Toby Yelsons! Come out!]\n\n\n“What are you?”\n\n\n“Where are you from? Send us back!”\n\n\nThe men showed their hostility towards Isel.\n\n\nJenna dried up.\n\n\n“Stop it. If you touch it, you’ll get in bad shape.”\n\n\n“Are you one too? Did you bring us here?”\n\n\n“I’m not part of the gang. Like you, I was brought here. That’s why I got used to it first.”\n\n\n“What are you bothering about? You’ll find out in a few minutes anyway.”\n\n\nI said and walked into the gap of time and space.\n\n\nNo matter how much I or Jenna babble here, you won’t understand. Even if I knew, I wouldn’t accept it.\n\n\n“Haa, really.”\n\n\nJenna let out a deep sigh as if frustrated and followed him. I heard a voice screeching from behind.\n\n\n“My wife is waiting! Send me back quickly!”\n\n\n“I’m a poor farmer, so I don’t have a penny. You’ve found the wrong person!”\n\n\nI wondered how long Issel could endure.\n\n\nJenna asked me.\n\n\n“Am I going to die?”\n\n\n“You don’t have to touch me first.”\n\n\nAfter a while, a man came flying like a shot put. The man fell to the floor and groaned.\n\n\nThe other two soon flew here as well. Finally, when Isel entered, the door to the plaza was closed.\n\n\n[So if you don’t want to be thrown at me, listen carefully. Just like them.]\n\n\nThe leftmost mirror started to glow.\n\n\nThis is the main dungeon. The number of floors is probably the second floor. You can go back to the first floor, but there is no benefit at this point.\n\n\nAs the light gradually enveloped the room, the other party members knocked on the exit as if they thought they were dying. He even attacked Isel.\n\n\n[It’s annoying!]\n\n\nIsel flew up and avoided his hand.\n\n\nAnd it was full of light.\n\n\n[Floor 2.]\n\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n\n[Goal – Exterminate the enemy!]\n\n\n‘Field Type Plains.’\n\n\nSimilar to grassland, but subtly different. The grass was sparse and the floor sloped.\n\n\n‘It must be a wolf.’\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.3] X 2\n\n\n[Plain Wolf Lv.4] X 2\n\n\nTwo wolves with gray manes growling up the slope. Above them, goblins with catapults were picking up stones.\n\n\nI frowned. The topography and composition were also at our disadvantage. We have enemies below, enemies above. I don’t know if there are wolves, but there are also remote agents.\n\n\n“Me, me, what is that!”\n\n\n“Whoa.”\n\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ feels fear. All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Toby( )’ feels fear. All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Yelson’s ( )’ feels fear. All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\nDid an ordinary human ever have the experience of encountering a beast in his life?\n\n\nThe wolves are showing their hostility without regret. The soft flesh of a human could be seen with fangs capable of lightly biting and tearing.\n\n\ncalms the trembling heart It looks strong, but it’s not a big deal. I have experience in fighting, and I have become strong enough to become stronger.\n\n\n“Kreurrr…”\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ feels fear. All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\nYou can’t do that. I tapped Jenna on the shoulder. Jenna, who was trembling, suddenly shouted.\n\n\n“Aaaaaaa!”\n\n\n“Did you eat something wrong?!”\n\n\nDid you even do it?\n\n\nBut the next moment, Jenna regained her cool.\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ is free from fear.]\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“It’s okay. Wait… It was just like that for a while.”\n\n\n“You take care of those two goblins. Just make sure the stones don’t come to me, and I’ll take care of the wolves.”\n\n\nWhoa!\n\n\nA goblin threw a stone. Not on my side. It was towards Jenna, who had just been searching for a quiver. I ran forward and hit the stone with my shield.\n\n\n“I think this will be the last service!”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\nI glanced behind me and saw the other three trembling in one place.\n\n\n‘It’s not helpful either.’\n\n\nI don’t think I can even serve as bait this time. The enemies were clearly targeting me and Jenna.\n\n\nI bit my lip hard. I won’t be like them. fight to the end\n\n\nAnd survive.\n\n\n“Kwaaang!”\n\n\nA wolf jumped in with open teeth. He is a quadrupedal animal. Its jumping ability is different from that of a humanoid. However, this pattern was expected.\n\n\nI shoved the old iron sword into the mouth of the wolf that was charging at me.\n\n\n“Aren’t you dead?”\n\n\nThe wolf struggled in pain, but did not die in one blow.\n\n\nEven though it penetrated the roof of the mouth, it seems that the tip of the knife did not reach the brain. He tried to pull out his sword, but he couldn’t pull it out because it was caught on a bone. On top of the hill another one lingered.\n\n\n‘Is it because the weapon is worn out?’\n\n\nScary to think, another wolf jumped up. I put my stomach on the floor and lay on my stomach. The terrain here is sloping. The wolf’s leap grazed the air.\n\n\nAs soon as I got up, I ran and kicked the wolf in the head with the sword in its mouth. He drew his sword with both arms. After that, he put a sword on his forehead.\n\n\n‘For once.’\n\n\n“Kong-kong-kong-kwang!”\n\n\nA wolf howled at the bottom of the hill.\n\n\nposition was reversed. I’m above and the wolf is below.\n\n\nThe wolf ran at me in a straight line. no need to back down I also rushed forward with my shield.\n\n\nWhen they collided like that, I struck the wide-mouthed wolf on the cheek with my shield, then drove an iron sword into its side.\n\n\n“Kaeng! Gaegaeng!”\n\n\nThe wolf, who had been rolling on the floor, stretched out after a while.\n\n\n‘Two.’\n\n\nWhat happened to the goblins?\n\n\nI looked up at the top of the hill. Two goblins that had been turned into hedgehogs by arrows were lying face down. An arrow pierced the goblin’s corpse with a piercing sound.\n\n\n“Stop it! I’m dead.”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nBlood dripped from Jenna’s forehead. It was like being hit by a stone.\n\n\n[Stage cleared!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ ‘Jenna( )’ level up!]\n\n\n[Reward – 5000G Leather (C) X 3 Iron Ore (C) X 1]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘Han( )’]\n\n\nInto the space-time gap I’m back.\n\n\nJenna rubbed the wound on her forehead that had disappeared with a curious look on her face, while the other three were still unconscious.\n\n\n[Congratulations on breaking through the 2nd floor!]\n\n\n[Going up to the 3rd floor.]\n\n\nTremble. Kurur.\n\n\nThe waiting room vibrated.\n\n\n“What, what happened?”\n\n\nA man muttered in a dull voice.\n\n\nIssel did not appear. Did it bother you at all? I decided not to care either.\n\n\n‘Status Window’\n\n\n[Han Israat ( ) Lv. 6(Exp 13/50)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 17/17]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 14/14]\n\n\n[Stamina: 16/16]\n\n\n[Agility: 16/16]\n\n\n[Possessed Skills: Lesser Swordsmanship (Lv.1) Lesser Shield Skill (Lv.1)]\n\n\n‘Good.’\n\n\nIntelligence decreased by 1, but strength increased by 2. The overall growth value was still 4, but the level-up efficiency improved. It was evidence that his constitution was improving.\n\n\n[Are you sure you want to terminate the master connection?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Then goodbye!]\n\n\nOne floor per day.\n\n\nEven the master is not in a hurry to slow down. If I had to go as far as I was on the first floor, it would have been dangerous for me and for me. Although there were no wounds, the fatigue remained.\n\n\nI went into the armory, hung up my shield, and came out.\n\n\nJenna and three others were murmuring.\n\n\n“Why are you only watching from behind? We were the only ones fighting!”\n\n\n“You don’t have to tell me the situation! What is what!”\n\n\n“I told you at the beginning! You just have to fight!”\n\n\n“Why do I have to fight? Where is this again? What are those monsters, and what kind of magic did they drag us to such a place!”\n\n\n“It’s not that important, you have to fight first to survive. You can think about it later.”\n\n\n“I’ve never even held a knife before, so how can I fight a monster!”\n\n\n“Do you know who has fought?”\n\n\nThe quarrel intensified.\n\n\nJenna insisted that we were summoned to fight just like we had been, and that we must work together and work together to survive. But the other three were different. They insisted that something like this could not happen to me and made a fuss.\n\n\nIt’s not being able to accept reality.\n\n\nI thought I now know why 1 star is called waste.\n\n\n1 star is normal people. He lived a life unrelated to the battlefield. Even if he recalled his self-introduction during the 10th consecutive summon, no one had a job related to combat.\n\n\nA 2 star Mormont if there was one.\n\n\nYou said you were a mercenary.\n\n\n‘Then, the higher the star, the higher the combat position will be summoned.’\n\n\nAlso, advanced heroes don’t get lost.\n\n\nIf you put freshly picked 1-star heroes into battle, you will get a hundred fears or panics. However, 3 stars and above were different. The battle started right away.\n\n\n‘I wonder if they were summoned knowingly.’\n\n\nThe reason to fight and the purpose of it.\n\n\nShay would have known. It was clear from the attitude.\n\n\nIf I had been a little more calm, I might have asked.\n\n\n“Wow, there’s all that stuff!”\n\n\nJenna hurriedly entered the armory, returned the bow, and left.\n\n\n“Would it be better if my brother helped me a little? We have to fight together, so we have to calm him down and make him an ally.”\n\n\n“Why am I with such useless bastards?”\n\n\n“It’s better than nothing.”\n\n\n“They’re going to disappear soon anyway.”\n\n\n“yes?”\n\n\n“You’ll find out when you see it.”\n\n\nYou don’t die fighting.\n\n\nIf it stays that way until the next battle, they will disappear.\n\n\nI looked at the door of the synthetic lab, which was closed.\n\n\n“You and I will fight together in the next battle. Never mind them.”\n\n\nJenna looked dissatisfied, but soon nodded.\n\n\n“Oh, and let’s go to your house.”\n\n\n“Is this my room?”\n\n\n“I’m curious how it came about. Why, don’t you like it?”\n\n\n“all right.”\n\n\nWe passed the center of the plaza and headed to the inn. On the way, a man who had been whispering in the corner of the plaza approached.\n\n\n“Boss, I want to ask you something!”\n\n\n“Don’t ask. It’s annoying.”\n\n\n“what!”\n\n\nThe man tried to grab me by the collar.\n\n\nI hit the man in the face with my fist.\n\n\n“100 million!”\n\n\nThe man turned ugly.\n\n\n“Is that the attitude of those who danced behind us while we bleed?”\n\n\n“Oh, no! I…”\n\n\nI spat and moved on. The man was grimacing as he clutched at his bleeding nose.\n\n\n“Hehehe.”\n\n\n“Cut what?”\n\n\n“It’s nothing.”\n\n\nJenna opened the door to the inn.\n\n\nThe interior of the room, which was made by weaving wood together, was revealed. Tables, chairs, display cases, and other furniture were lined up, and the walls were studded with luminous stones.\n\n\nThe triumphs of modern civilization, such as refrigerators and gas stoves, were not visible.\n\n\n[Accommodation Lv.1]\n\n\nAccommodation?\n\n\nStrictly speaking, this place would literally be the lodgings of heroes rather than Zena’s house. In other words, those three lousy people will be staying here.\n\n\n‘Why is it only me in that room?’\n\n\nI don’t know now.\n\n\nI decided to think slowly.\n\n\n“What do you want? I only have potatoes.”\n\n\n“All you have are potatoes?”\n\n\n“About potatoes, salt, and water? Even if you eat, it’ll be filled the next day, but that’s all.”\n\n\nMy room only has ramen and orange juice.\n\n\nIt must be because the lodging level is low.\n\n\nJenna took some potatoes from the display case, skewered them, and tossed them into the hearth in the middle of the room.\n\n\nWhile the potatoes were cooking, I inspected the inn.\n\n\nInside, corridors stretched long, and rooms were located.\n\n\nRight now there are only a few rooms and the facilities are not good, but as the accommodation level goes up, it will gradually become bigger and wider.\n\n\nWhen you first start the game, you have a limit of 20 heroes. You have to upgrade your accommodation to be able to summon more heroes. This is how the Pick Me Up system is implemented here.\n\n\nPotatoes were delicious.",
