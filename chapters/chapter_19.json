You’re not mistaken!”\n\n“I want to think so too!”\n\n“Come down at once.”\n\nAfter Jenna came down, I called the party members together.\n\nI know what to do in this situation. I have the experience of observing and analyzing thousands of battles. Among them, there were also other people’s play records that were not mine.\n\nEven if it seems impossible, the attack definitely exists.\n\nHowever, in the case of this mission, the difficulty was quite high.\n\n“Brother. Thousands of goblins. Isn’t it wrong? Five people…” “Don’t be\n\nscared. It’s not about killing all the thousands. This mission is not subjugation. It’s survival. You just have to endure it.”\n\n“Wouldn’t it be fine if we hid?”\n\n“Where?”\n\nGide jumped up and ran to the empty house.\n\nAfter a while, he returned with a bitter expression.\n\n“You can’t go inside the building…”\n\n“You can’t go outside the city, let alone the building. We have to compete here. It’s not about hiding, it’s about holding out.”\n\n“A large army of goblins with five people…”\n\n“For now, move the location.”\n\nThe square is not a good position to defend. Roads stretched out in all directions, and there were many passages to enter, such as cracks in collapsed buildings. If you stay here, you will be surrounded and annihilated in an instant.\n\n‘A narrow area where the path through which the enemy enters has been set and only one enemy can be dealt with at a time.’\n\n“How long can I last?”\n\n“It’s 10 minutes. Encounter the enemy, and if you hold out for 10 minutes, you can go back.”\n\n“Then it might be worth a try!”\n\n[30:00]\n\nYou probably don’t need to tell me the exact time.\n\n‘No luck.’\n\nIf a survival mission takes place on the lower floors, the chance of the party surviving is only 9%. It’s not a big deal in the high-rise section, but the survival mission on the lower floor was so original that it was called ‘Hero Grinder’.\n\n‘Anyway, I survive.’\n\nIt is only on the 5th floor.\n\nIf you die here, the Master of Master’s name will laugh at you.\n\n“Move! The five of us find a place to shut up. Get into the city!”\n\n“yes!”\n\nAssuming we were summoned to the south of the city, the city’s destruction becomes worse the further north we go. According to Jenna’s report, goblins are also coming from the north.\n\nThen to the south where the buildings are relatively intact.\n\n“It can’t be the road. Let’s go to the alley.”\n\nThe core of this mission is to find a key point for defense.\n\nWe fell into an alley on one side of the boulevard. The road became narrow enough for one person to spread their shoulders.\n\nThere was no way to die like that. Suitable space for defense was soon found.\n\nIt was an alley with three roads. There are no gaps like dog holes, and the walls are so high that it is difficult to climb.\n\n“Let’s go here.”\n\nThere were several other candidates besides this one, but it was a place where the enemy could invade because the walls were collapsed here and there or the walls were low. I wanted to find a narrow area with only one aisle and confined on all sides, but now I don’t have much time.\n\nkia ah.\n\nGoblin cries were heard in the distance.\n\n“Gather together. I’ll set a location.”\n\n“Location?”\n\n“Each passageway to defend. The roads are all narrow, so you only have to deal with one at a time. Thousands or tens of thousands, one at a time. Is that possible?”\n\n“Yes, I will!”\n\nGide responded loudly.\n\nyeah let’s try it\n\n“First, I take the passage on the left, and Aaron takes the passage on the right.”\n\n“Yes, brother!”\n\n“Gide and Hanson are in charge of the lower aisle. If one of them gets tired of blocking, they take turns. Don’t forget. It’s not about fighting together, it’s about taking turns. Once you’re in, don’t go out to help and take a good rest. Okay?”\n\n“yes!”\n\nI’m in charge of the narrowest passage on the left.\n\nThe passage on the right, which is relatively wide, is Aaron. Since this guy uses a spear, he needed at least enough width to wield the spear.\n\nsaid Jenna.\n\n“Me?”\n\n“You wait in the middle of the three-way intersection.”\n\n“Wait?”\n\n“Don’t shoot arrows. Just wait.”\n\n“If you’re afraid you might shoot your teammate, don’t worry. I’m confident.”\n\n“That’s not the problem. Arrows must be saved unconditionally.”\n\nJenna’s location is a small open space in the middle where three passages merge into one.\n\nIf Jenna shoots an arrow here, of course there is a chance that her ally will be hit. The person in charge of the aisle turns their backs on Jenna. There are high walls on either side, so the angle of fire is quite limited.\n\nBut there were other reasons.\n\n“Save it anyway. Don’t shoot until I tell you to. Okay?”\n\n“yes.”\n\nI didn’t understand, but Jenna nodded.\n\n“I’ll give you some tips. Open your ears and listen.”\n\n“yes!”\n\n“First, move the goblin corpses as far forward as possible. Build a wall.\n\n“yes!”\n\n“If you get tired from fighting and can’t stand it, call Jenna.”\n\n“Then can I shoot an arrow!”\n\n“No, you take the dagger and hold on there instead. When the person in charge catches his breath for a moment, it’s time for another shift.”\n\n“Ugh…”\n\n“You can shoot if you really don’t want to. Instead, make sure to retrieve the arrow. Either the person in charge of the area throws it back or you run to catch it.”\n\n“all right.”\n\nThere are only 20 arrows in Jenna’s quiver.\n\nThousands of enemies to face. Arrows should be used only where necessary.\n\n“Keep in mind. If even one of the three passages is breached, we’ll be lost here. If you’re surrounded from the front and back, you’ll never survive.”\n\n“I’ll keep that in mind!”\n\n“Then to the location!”\n\nThe four of them scattered with determined expressions on their faces.\n\n“Kerreuk?”\n\nThe goblin’s cry began to be heard.\n\n[30: 00]\n\n’30 minutes…’\n\nPerhaps the time flow of the stage, not the waiting room, coincides with the Earth.\n\nHowever, the timer will start immediately after engaging the goblins.\n\n“Build a barricade before the goblins come!”\n\n“All right!”\n\nI stacked piles of broken stones or wood chips in front of the road.\n\n“Don’t waste your stamina! Swing it short and simple!”\n\n“All right!”\n\nI like one answer.\n\nHe built a small barrier by stacking objects around him. I looked behind me and saw Aaron and Gide Hanson doing the same thing.\n\n“Kyaa!”\n\nFinally, the goblin caught this side.\n\n[29:59]\n\n‘Come.’\n\nIt is not a mission to protect only my body. If either side is breached, everyone in the clearing will be at risk.\n\n‘I have no choice but to trust Jenna.’\n\nIt is the most unnecessary role on the surface, but the reality is completely different.\n\nDue to the nature of this mission, the limit of physical strength will come unconditionally. If Jenna doesn’t fill that gap, it will break through without help.\n\n“Kiaaaaagh!”\n\nGoblins started to attack the alley.\n\nI thrust my sword through the gap in the stacked trees. The black went through the goblin’s neck. The goblin fell face down, blood pouring from its neck.\n\n“Pile up bodies! Build a wall!”\n\nI repeated the same story for the group to hear.\n\n“Okay!”\n\nAron and Gide’s cries were heard from afar.\n\nAnd the sound of swords clashing continued.\n\none at a time.\n\nAim for the chest or head. I diligently thrust my sword through the gap.\n\n“Keiy, Kiyi, Kiyi!”\n\nThe goblins also stabbed their swords through the cracks in the barricade.\n\nBlock it with a shield and return it.\n\n“Kek!”\n\none falls down\n\nBeyond the alleyway, there were groups of goblins that could not be counted. They pushed themselves into each other’s alley as if they wanted to go first.\n\n‘Like a dog…’\n\nSome goblins dragged the corpses out of the alley, probably noticing that the corpses on the floor were an obstacle. It was a narrow passage that could barely fit one person, but the goblin’s small size made it possible.\n\n“Kyaa!”\n\nThe goblin in the lead stabbed with a sword.\n\nIt is a circle pattern. block and stab back\n\nBeneath them, the sullen goblins began to dismantle the barricade. I hit the goblin’s head, which was exposed through the crack, with my shield. Blood spurted from the smashed head.\n\nI looked back.\n\nThe three of them swing their weapons through the gaps in each of the obstacles they have piled up and do not back down an inch.\n\n“Tell me anytime if you’re having a hard time!”\n\nJenna in the clearing shouted.\n\n‘not there yet.’\n\nAs he raised his sword and cut it, the severed goblin’s arm flew through the air. The goblin, missing one arm, swung a claw at the barrier with the other hand. His sharp claws tore through his leather wrist guards.\n\nI put my sword through his head.\n\nThe goblin right behind took the corpse.\n\n‘Haa, bastards really.’\n\nIf you look stupid, you pay for stupidity.\n\nThey are gradually learning. When the goblin in front died, it dragged it out of the alley as if it had been waiting for it, and crouched on the floor of the alley, gradually carrying stones or wooden boards out. There was even a guy who tried to step on his colleague’s shoulder and pass through the aisle. The road gradually opened.\n\n[26:48]\n\nI forgot to count the dead goblins from the 10th.\n\nThese guys are weak. They are kids who only come out on the first floor. His body was thin and his strength was weak.\n\nBut there are many.\n\nThere were too many.\n\n“Ki-yi-yi!”\n\nThe tip of the sword tore the goblin’s eyeball. The goblin let out a desperate scream. He drew his sword and twisted it sideways.\n\nAs soon as he kicked it, he went round with the others behind him.\n\nThe goblins gathered on the main street show no signs of diminishing.\n\nAre these guys fearless? They come and go as if they want to die.\n\nMore than half of the barricades have been dismantled.\n\nI slipped my right foot back.\n\nThe goblin who had been sticking out through the gap in the barricade cut the spot where my right foot had been with a dagger. Put the sword down in the back of the head.\n\nlooked back\n\nAaron on the right is clearing the goblins with a thrust while holding his spear short.\n\nThe difference in range is overwhelming. It was still doing well.\n\nDownstairs, Gide was sweating and panting.\n\n“Gide, shift!”\n\n“Oh, I can still do more…”\n\n“Shut up, shift if you want!”\n\n“You rest! I’ll do it!”\n\nHanson, who had been waiting, ran out with a sword and shield.\n\nGide slipped into the clearing and took a deep breath.\n\n‘Still low on stamina.’\n\nThat was the reason I placed Gide and Hansson in the same group. Those guys are not only low level, they lack skills. I don’t know if it’s the excitement or tension of the battle, but every time I attack the enemy, I give a lot of strength.\n\nIt means you get tired easily.\n\nOne sword is enough.\n\none at a time.\n\nRelax your body and swing gently.\n\nProduce maximum efficiency with minimum physical strength.\n\nstab and\n\nslash and\n\nstab again\n\nThe bodies were piling up faster than the goblins were clearing them out.\n\n[22:58]\n\n“Switch again!”\n\n“Hanson!”\n\n“Ah Okay!”\n\nHanson was replaced by Gide.\n\nThe barricade at the bottom, which the two men were in charge of, was almost breached. The aisle beyond it was packed with dozens of goblins. Some of them were trampled to death, but they showed no signs of caring.\n\n‘That’s the most dangerous!’\n\nI tried to call Jenna.\n\nOne blocks and the other reinforces the barricade.\n\nThen\n\n“Kei!”\n\nA goblin’s head appeared on a high wall on one side of the clearing.\n\n“Don’t let me fall over!”\n\n“I’ve been waiting!”\n\nping!\n\nAn arrow pierced the goblin’s head. The goblin, who was trying to climb over the wall, collapsed into the clearing just as he did.\n\nOn the other side of the clearing, goblins were climbing the wall again.\n\n“Jenna, you take care of the goblins that cross into the clearing! Got it?”\n\n“Old write!”\n\nA goblin stuck out its head from the opposite wall.\n\nZena’s arrow pierced his forehead again.\n\n“Retrieve the arrows!”\n\nJenna quickly ran to the corpse and drew an arrow. On the other side of the wall, the goblins were climbing the wall again.\n\nIf you allow them to enter the clearing, you will be surrounded in front and back.\n\n“Tongue, brother! Didn’t you say 10 minutes?”\n\n“Dude, it’s only been five minutes!”\n\n[18:49]\n\n“Ouch!”\n\nGide grabbed his hand and rolled over.\n\nTwo of his left fingers were cut off. Blood was gushing out.",
