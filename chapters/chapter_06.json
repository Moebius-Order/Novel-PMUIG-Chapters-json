Free 10 Draw (1)\n\n\nWhen I woke up the next day, everything was the same.\n\n\n“Whoa…”\n\n\nHe let out a sigh that came from the depths of his chest.\n\n\nIt’s been a while since I quit smoking, but it’s the first time since I ate a 6-star party on the 80th floor that I wanted to smoke so much.\n\n\ndecided to accept\n\n\nThe foolishness of a child is now over. This was a pick me up world, and I was summoned as a first-star hero.\n\n\nThe gruesome ability compared to Shay.\n\n\nNovice class without even basics.\n\n\nno skills at all This was me now.\n\n\nI wash my face in the bathroom and cook ramen. The pot I ate yesterday was still there. Wash the dishes while the water boils.\n\n\nI thought while wiping the pot with a sponge dipped in pom-pom.\n\n\nWhat kind of game is Pick Me Up?\n\n\nIf someone is summoned as a pick me up hero with the rules of the game applied, how can he survive?\n\n\nThere are two ways a hero can be destroyed.\n\n\ndying in battle and disappearing through synthesis.\n\n\nAnd I was 1 star.\n\n\nWhat does a 1-star hero mean in Pick Me Up?\n\n\n1 star is consumable for most masters. It is also a low-end consumable. The basic ability is poor and the growth rate is very low. And I’m already annoyed to write it, but I’m often caught in a status abnormality and my combat power is reduced.\n\n\nThe same goes for other mobile games.\n\n\nThe treatment of characters that come out of the free lottery is all like that.\n\n\nI slurped my noodles.\n\n\nBefore I knew it, I had paper and a pen in my hands. It was something I found in a drawer beside my bed. I don’t know why this is in the room. If you can write, just write.\n\n\n‘target.’\n\n\nScribbled words on paper.\n\n\nonce a goal The first goal is nothing to see. survive in this world\n\n\nAnd you need to set specific goals.\n\n\nIf this had happened to any other mobile game, I would have given up. The growth of the character is fixed and the skill is also fixed. No matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to escape from your origin.\n\n\nBut Pick Me Up is different.\n\n\nDepending on the upbringing method and the individual hero’s ability, a born 1 star can be reborn as a born 5 star hero.\n\n\nIt is because of the potential that is uniquely assigned to each hero. Each hero has other abilities besides the visible status window. It is not displayed as a number, and it is something that the Master must understand while watching the battle.\n\n\nAt first, even if they have the same stars and abilities, a completely different hero is born.\n\n\nTherefore, in order to become a pick me up master, it was necessary to have a ‘differentiation plan’ to pick out the ‘potential cotyledons’.\n\n\nThe pen writes down the words.\n\n\n‘target. become stronger.’\n\n\nBe strong.\n\n\nSurvival, revenge, and returning are impossible unless I become stronger.\n\n\nIt’s not just physical strength. You have to change your mental side as well.\n\n\nYou will never survive with the peaceful mindset you have on Earth.\n\n\nI don’t know how things will go after that. If you are in a hurry and panic like yesterday, will you be able to survive?\n\n\n‘no.’\n\n\nIf you don’t adapt, you die.\n\n\nIf you don’t accept it, you get eaten.\n\n\nI’ve been through this situation before.\n\n\nNow I’m just a young man who could be anywhere, but it was different in the past.\n\n\nChildhood. I remembered the annoyed gaze of the orphanage director looking at me. At that time, I had nothing. Parents, relatives and friends. Everyone was the enemy and I was alone.\n\n\nIt came up a lot. I lived a life like war to live a life like others.\n\n\n‘are you okay.’\n\n\naccustomed to injustice\n\n\nThe important thing is to calmly assess and accept the situation.\n\n\nThe absurd fact that I fell into the world of a game I enjoyed.\n\n\nNo one should be trusted under these circumstances.\n\n\nThe only one I can trust is me.\n\n\nAfter eating ramen, we went out to the plaza.\n\n\nThe square was still empty.\n\n\n“Isel, are you there!”\n\n\nI cried.\n\n\nAfter a while, a little fairy appeared in the air.\n\n\n[Oh why! I’m a busy body!]\n\n\nEven though you’re busy, you come out well.\n\n\n[I know that because no matter how much I ask, I won’t tell you! Climb the tower if you’re curious. Because there is an answer in it. Oh, of course, there’s no way a 1-star trash like you will go all the way, but kyahahaha!]\n\n\nIssel grabbed his stomach and burst into laughter.\n\n\nI don’t get angry. Now that my mind has calmed down, I can check the level of this kid.\n\n\n[Isel Lv.257]\n\n\nIf it is 257, it is the boss level of the late 80th floor.\n\n\n“I have a question.”\n\n\n[They won’t tell you.]\n\n\n“Is this status window visible only to me?”\n\n\n[Status window?]\n\n\nIssel flapped his wings and circled the air.\n\n\n“Level 257 floating above your head.”\n\n\n[Ha, do you see this too? I haven’t even researched it yet. It’s annoying. It’s annoying.]\n\n\nLooking at the reaction, it’s clear.\n\n\nThe message of the game is still only visible to ‘me’.\n\n\n[Is it because existence is mixed up? After all, he’s been annoying too… Mom! What am I talking about!]\n\n\nIsel looked around and quickly ran away.\n\n\nAre the beings mixed up? It’s good.\n\n\n“Equipment window!”\n\n\n[Han Israt( )]\n\n\n[Main weapon: None]\n\n\n[Sub weapon: None]\n\n\n[Armor: None]\n\n\n[Accessories: None]\n\n\nAs expected.\n\n\nThe iron sword I used in the tutorial was a supply that was automatically given to the hero when he had no weapon. Shay, like a 4-star born, had basic weapons and armor.\n\n\n‘good.’\n\n\nI clenched my fists.\n\n\nEven though it’s 1 star, it has a special ability that others don’t have. Being able to observe my condition from the master’s point of view. It will be of great help in your future career.\n\n\nI am not weeded out never.\n\n\ndecided once again.\n\n\nBut\n\n\nwhat if the Master leaves it like this?\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nThe accident caused by Master yesterday was not an ordinary mistake.\n\n\n4 stars combined into 1 star. The probability of getting 4 stars in a paid summon is about 1%.\n\n\nThe luck that might happen once in a hundred was blown away by a single control miss.\n\n\nPick Me Up is linked to the mobile phone, so it was impossible to restart it.\n\n\n‘Let’s not think negatively.’\n\n\nAt that time, you just have to go and think about it.\n\n\nThere is no need to waste your energy on an incident that never happened.\n\n\nI immediately shut myself in my room and scrawled a piece of paper. There were plenty of notebooks and pens in the drawer. If you think you need it, something that didn’t exist was created.\n\n\nMaking is a strategy book. I describe and organize all the information about Pick Me Up that I remember so that I do not forget it over time.\n\n\nA week passed like that.\n\n\n[Welcome to Master Amkenna Pick Me Up!]\n\n\nA hologram window came up with a cheerful sound.\n\n\nI jumped up from my chair.\n\n\n[Loading has finished.]\n\n\n[TOUCH ! (optional)]\n\n\n[Great fun event for new masters!]\n\n\n[1. 100 gems a day for 10 days! A total of 1000 gems will be given.]\n\n\n[2. Special products that can only be purchased by new masters! A new package is available. 5,000 gems and 300,000 gold for only 65,000 won to the master!]\n\n\n[Write a review and get a star rating!]\n\n\n[I am the king of capture! On the official cafe…]\n\n\nNotices popped up, and events in progress were listed.\n\n\nEvents are things that I have memorized most of the time, but I don’t remember.\n\n\nThe announcement was soon skipped.\n\n\nDuring the tutorial, I was distracted and couldn’t look, but it’s different from now on. You need to know what type of master your master is in order to devise a survival strategy.\n\n\nAre you a non-paying user or a paying user?\n\n\nAre you a light user or a hard user?\n\n\nI paid attention to system messages.\n\n\n[Please check the master tutorial reward!]\n\n\n[500 gems and 200,000 gold acquired!]\n\n\n‘If you have 500 gems, you can draw once and if you have 200,000 gold, you can draw 20 times free.’\n\n\n[pop-up! Would you like to purchase a new package for 65,000 won?]\n\n\n[Yes / No (optional)]\n\n\n‘I’m not buying it.’\n\n\nAre you a non-paying user at least for now?\n\n\nYou may still be looking at the estimate.\n\n\nIt would be nice if you could see the game screen itself rather than just looking at system messages, but unfortunately, that function was not given.\n\n\nSo what are you going to do?\n\n\nIn the current situation, I am the only hero. Then, what the Master should do in this situation is…\n\n\n[Summon a hero!]\n\n\n[Summon a hero with gold or gems. Choose the infinite heroes summoned by Moebius Summon!]\n\n\nInfinite heroes are horns.\n\n\nIf my hypothesis is correct, everything like Moebius Thurman or the hero’s unique artificial intelligence are all good. It was only after falling directly into the game that I knew.\n\n\n[Advanced Summon]\n\n\n[Perform an advanced hero summon.]\n\n\n[Summon 1 time – 500 gems]\n\n\n[Summon 10 times – 5000 gems]\n\n\n[Summon]\n\n\n[Perform a hero summon.]\n\n\n[Summon 1 time – 10000 gold]\n\n\n[10 Summon twice – 100000 gold]\n\n\nAs expected, Amkena touched the summoning station.\n\n\nNo wonder. There is no way to progress through a stage with only one 1-star hero unless you are a crazy person.\n\n\nThe top is the common ‘paid draw’ with gems, and the bottom is the common ‘free draw’ with gold.\n\n\nAmkena touched the summon ‘Free Draw’.\n\n\n[Master 10 series summoning begins. I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of hero will come out!]\n\n\n[Talkak dururu.]\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ has learned the hero ‘Lyle’!] [\n\n\nCommon!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ Kenna’ has learned the hero ‘Toby ( )’!]\n\n\n[Uncommon!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ has learned the hero ‘Mormont (★★)’!]\n\n\n[Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ ‘Nim….’\n\n\nA total of ten messages came to mind. Summoning is over.\n\n\nI started counting slowly in my mind.\n\n\nfrom 1 to 100. I calmed down as I counted. No matter what happens outside, don’t get excited. Don’t panic.\n\n\nAfter counting, I went out to the square.\n\n\nThe summoning station was open and 10 men and women were gathered near the entrance of the summoning station.\n\n\nThey chattered in a corner of the plaza with embarrassed faces.\n\n\n“Where are you? Dream Seal?”\n\n\n“Ah, it’s harvest season…!”\n\n\n“Maybe they were brought in by a wizard? We use them as experimental tools…”\n\n\n“Stop talking nonsense!”\n\n\nAlthough they differ in age, gender and appearance, they have several things in common.\n\n\nThe first race is the same. Probably of white descent.\n\n\nThe second one speaks the same language. Neither Japanese nor Chinese. It’s not even Spanish or French. I wrote a language similar to English but with a different feeling, and I can understand the contents. you might be able to say\n\n\nAnd the third,\n\n\nthey are human.\n\n\n“Now, it’s fate that we met like this, so let’s introduce ourselves first.”\n\n\nA middle-aged man with a handsome beard stepped forward. He was wearing a leather tunic and worn trousers.\n\n\nA middle-aged man gestured to me from a distance.\n\n\n“You come here too.”\n\n\nI trudged through the crowd.\n\n\nThe red long-haired girl pointed to the door of the summoning station and shouted. The door was already closed.\n\n\n“This brother, he came from outside the door, not from that door! He’s different from us! You might know something.”\n\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n\n“Yes, I saw it.” You\n\n\n‘re being cunning.\n\n\nI said,\n\n\n“I’m just like you guys. I’m from that door\n\n. "",
