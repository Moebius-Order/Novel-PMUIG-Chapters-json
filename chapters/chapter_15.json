Strengthening internal stability (3)\n\n\nWe returned to the space-time gap.\n\n\nI brushed off the blood on my sword.\n\n\n“It’s over somehow.”\n\n\n“Woo-wook, keo-uk…!”\n\n\nAaron fell on his stomach and vomited gastric juices. His whole body was covered with cold sweat. The hand holding the spear trembled violently.\n\n\n“are you okay?”\n\n\n“It’s okay…”\n\n\nJenna rubbed Aaron’s back. After Aaron calmed down, we went out into the square. As the space-time gap closed, Aaron looked at the closed synthetic lab door with trembling eyes.\n\n\n“What about me?”\n\n\n“I don’t know either.”\n\n\nIn fact, in the battle just now, Aaron didn’t do much. It was said to be a link between me and Jenna, but between us, we only stabbed or swung spears without thinking.\n\n\nStill, it was better than nothing.\n\n\n[Register ‘Aaron ( )’ to Favorites.]\n\n\n“It’s alive.”\n\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n\n“Can’t you see it? It won’t open.”\n\n\n“Lived! I, survived, remained!”\n\n\nAaron knelt down and raised his hands.\n\n\n[Register ‘Heavy Steel Sword (-C)’ to ‘Han( )’ exclusive equipment.] [Register ‘\n\n\nHard Iron Shield (C)’ to ‘Han( )’ exclusive equipment.] [\n\n\n‘ Register ‘Balanced Shortbow (C)’ to ‘Jenna ( )”s exclusive equipment.] [\n\n\nRegister ‘Sharp Longsword (C-)’ to ‘Aaron ( )”s exclusive equipment.] ”\n\n\nBut the arsenal doesn’t open. Is that right? Don’t you have to return the weapon?”\n\n\nsaid Jenna.\n\n\nI looked at the message that the dedicated equipment was registered. Exclusive equipment refers to a system that assigns a specific item to that hero. Exclusive equipment cannot be used by anyone other than the designated hero. Therefore, there was no need to keep it in the arsenal either.\n\n\n“I think you should have it.”\n\n\n“Can I not return it? I wanted to practice with this bow instead of the wooden bow!”\n\n\nJenna’s eyes twinkled. I nodded, and Jenna cheered and took the bow into her arms.\n\n\nCertainly, the wooden series provided at the training center is different in weight and size from the actual weapons we use. If you want to get your hands on a weapon that you will use in real combat, it would be much better to carry it around.\n\n\n“Then can I go back? I think today is over.”\n\n\n“Wait still. It’s not over.”\n\n\nThe gaps in time and space, the synthesis, and the arsenal were closed, but the light in the sky did not go out. I trudged to a corner of the plaza and sat down.\n\n\n“Nina, brother is coming! Wait!”\n\n\n“…Bring him some too.”\n\n\nJenna came toward me, dragging Aaron, who was kneeling and performing a strange ceremony.\n\n\n[pop-up! Would you like to purchase a new package for 65,000 won?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nA bundle containing blue jewels and gold coins appeared on the hologram screen.\n\n\n[One-time jackpot payment new package for new masters!]\n\n\n[5,000 gems and 300,000 gold for only 65,000 won!]\n\n\n[The amount will be added to the next month’s mobile phone bill.

You want to stop eating baked potatoes.”\n\n\nTo conclude, Pick Me Up is a creative game.\n\n\nUnlike other mobile games, gems are not given for clearing missions, and there are almost no events that spread gems. Even if you say anything like a great box office event for new masters, in reality, all you have to do is give 1000 gems over 10 days. Even if it is 1000 gems, it will be robbed in Paid Gacha No. 2 Basic Facility Construction No. 2. This means that there are limited ways to obtain gems, a high-end commodity, free of charge in Pick Me Up.\n\n\n‘I knew I would pay.’\n\n\nIt was time for some fun.\n\n\nVarious reactions of heroes and realistic battles. Obviously, Amkena will feel like putting a real human in the waiting room, not data made of 0s and 1s. I have no choice but to do that because I am a real human being.\n\n\nAmkena’s face gradually began to show.\n\n\nFirst, the access time is fixed. It was highly likely that the job had a fixed commute time. Unlike the first time when he didn’t know anything and messed around with 1 stars, he steadily expanded the facilities for a while. And today, I even used a dedicated equipment function that is unknown with in-game tips. There was a high probability that they had seen the strategy on a site related to Pick Me Up.\n\n\n‘If you are a user who sees the strategy, you can predict where you will use the 5000 gems.’\n\n\n[Build the facility. Please touch the type of facility you want.]\n\n\n[You have selected ‘Accommodation Lv.1’. Do you want to expand the building?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[The lodging has reached level 2. The hero retention limit will increase.]\n\n\n[You have selected ‘Restaurant’, an annex of ‘Accommodation’. Do you want to build it?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nThe square trembled.\n\n\nAaron and Jenna started to panic at the unexpected vibration. I watched the construction completion window that came to mind in detail.\n\n\n[You have selected ‘Carpentry Shop’, an annex of ‘Arsenal’. Would you like to build it?]\n\n\n[The ‘Processing Shop’, an annex of the ‘Arsenal’…]\n\n\n[The ‘Training Center Lv.1’…]\n\n\n[The restaurant has been completed! A quality meal will be provided to the hero.]\n\n\n[The carpentry shop is complete! A bonus is given to crafting equipment.]\n\n\n[The processing plant is completed! A bonus is given to crafting equipment.]\n\n\n[The 3 types of annexes of the Armory, the Blacksmith’s Carpentry Workshop, are merged into a new facility, ‘Equipment Workshop’!]\n\n\n[The training center has reached level 2! Hero training efficiency increases.]\n\n\n[Great!]\n\n\n[The square evolves to Lv\n\n\n.\n\n\nA wooden bench and a small flower bed with blooming flowers. and fountain. There was a little bit of liveliness in the existing desolate atmosphere.\n\n\nOf course, as Jenna and Aaron had no clue whatsoever, they were stunned enough to lose their eyes. It would have seemed like something was being made in thin air.\n\n\nI briefly summarized the current phenomenon and explained it.\n\n\nBoth of them knew that this place was ruled by an existence called the Master.\n\n\n“You mean the waiting room gets better as you go up the floor, right?”\n\n\n“Is Master the Archmage? My God, this kind of thing is possible…”\n\n\nArchmage.\n\n\nIn a sense, it is correct.\n\n\n“Are you finally free from baked potatoes?”\n\n\n“If there was a restaurant, it would be a little better.”\n\n\nIt won’t change much, but it will be better than now.\n\n\n“Oh yea!”\n\n\nJenna jumped up and was delighted. Aaron didn’t feel bad either.\n\n\nWhat happened just now could be considered the reward of victory for the two of them. Just like the tip, scams will rise.\n\n\n“You mean you can eat expensive food if you fight harder?”\n\n\n“As long as it’s not considered useless by the Master.”\n\n\n“A top-quality lamb steak is a must-have!”\n\n\n“Brother, I’m happy with the turkey!”\n\n\nThe faces of the two were full of color.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I was coldly sinking. The two began to look at me quietly as I remained expressionless.\n\n\nsaid Aaron.\n\n\n“Is something wrong with you?”\n\n\n“If it’s useless, it’s thrown away, remember?”\n\n\nThe two nodded.\n\n\n“Don’t forget. That’s all you need.”\n\n\n“I’ll keep that in mind, brother!”\n\n\n“I will work even harder!”\n\n\n‘Three stars will come soon.’\n\n\nMaybe 4 stars, maybe even 5 stars.\n\n\nCurrently, we are in charge of the main attack party in this waiting room, but it is only filled up because there are no people, and it can be changed at any time depending on circumstances.\n\n\nI looked at the door of the summoning station.\n\n\nThat door was ready to open at any moment.\n\n\nEven now.\n\n\njust as expected.\n\n\n[Master 10 series summoning begins. I can’t wait to see what kind of hero will emerge!]\n\n\nJenna raised her voice after discovering the door to the summoning station.\n\n\n“Brother, is the summons opened?”\n\n\n“I’m done with the group leader, but I have to greet guests.”\n\n\nIt’s not a paid summon yet.\n\n\nIt was a normal summon with gold.\n\n\n[Talkak dururu.]\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[ Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’…]\n\n\n[Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’…]\n\n\nA couple of men and women walked out.\n\n\nNow that I’ve seen it twice, it’s not unfamiliar.\n\n\nAfter wandering around the corner of the plaza for a while, they found us. A bald man came up to us.\n\n\n“Everyone, who are you? Did you bring us here?”\n\n\nAn anxious expression. My voice is trembling.\n\n\nWhat is the reaction like?\n\n\nJenna said in a bitter voice.\n\n\n“It’s not us. A man called Master called you.”\n\n\n“Master? Who is he? A wizard?”\n\n\n“It’s similar.”\n\n\n“Who are you again! Why did we come here? Send them back immediately…”\n\n\n“Be quiet.”\n\n\nI scratched my head.\n\n\nHearing the same thing over and over again gave me a headache.\n\n\n“I have no intention of explaining it to you right now. You won’t believe it anyway. If there are people who come to their senses after surviving on their own, I’ll tell you then.”\n\n\n“Muh, what are you talking about! You…”\n\n\n“You said it was noisy.”\n\n\nI slightly pulled out the blade of the scabbard. The man’s face hardened when he saw it.\n\n\nThey are bare-handed, and each of us is armed with a sword, shield, bow and spear. The man said nothing and left.\n\n\nI am not a philanthropist like Jesus or Buddha, and I have no intention of expending my energy to explain.\n\n\n“Hyung-nim…”\n\n\n“Why, why don’t you go and convince me? You have to survive by fighting monsters? Do you think you’ll believe it?”\n\n\nI have no choice but to experience it myself.\n\n\nIf you roll with your body, you will realize even if you don’t like it.\n\n\n[Welcome to the tower, chickens!]\n\n\nIssel appeared and stretched out his chest. It seems that he was trying to create a sense of intimidation.\n\n\nIt was funny to me, but not to them.\n\n\n“You, who are you?”\n\n\n[Noisy and listen carefully. If you keep leaking and chattering, you’ll get scolded.]\n\n\nThe audience became quiet.\n\n\nIssel nodded with a satisfied expression, then continued.\n\n\n[Are there any of you who were carpenters?]\n\n\nA young man with an ordinary look raised his hand.\n\n\n[You fell that way.]\n\n\nThe young man fell to the left without a word.\n\n\n[Who was the next blacksmith or tanner?]\n\n\nNo one raised a hand this time.\n\n\nIssel clicked his tongue lightly and then spoke one last time.\n\n\n[Is there anyone who was a cook?]\n\n\n“My, I know how to cook!”\n\n\nThe middle-aged man who spoke to us raised his hand.\n\n\n[Then you fall in too.]\n\n\nThe man rolled his eyes and walked towards the carpenter.\n\n\n“What are you trying to do?”\n\n\n“It’s a division of roles. Just like if you have a restaurant you need a cook, if you have a forge you need a blacksmith.”\n\n\nI thought of Lyle, a middle-aged man who was summoned in the first 10 draw. You said you were a carpenter. That person was out of luck. If he had been summoned this time, he would have been able to fall into the carpentry shop.\n\n\nTo compare the current situation, it is like deciding on a position before enlisting.\n\n\nIf you have a talent for cooking, you become a cook, and if you have a talent for driving, you become a driver. As there is a facility to operate, Issel, who has been ordered by the Master, is classifying jobs.\n\n\n“Son, I’ll suck on the honey.”\n\n\nI said looking at the young man who was looking around in silence.\n\n\nWith the carpenter and cook missing, there are a total of eight people left.\n\n\n[Form a party.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop heroes!]\n\n\n[‘Gide( )’ joins ‘Party 2’!]\n\n\n[‘Hansson( )’ joins ‘Party 2’…] [\n\n\n‘ Zone() is in the ‘Party 2’…]\n\n\n[Open the space-time!]\n\n\nIf you don’t have much talent, you have no choice\n\n\nbut to roll over with your body.",
