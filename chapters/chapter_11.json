If you want to live, ride the rope well (3)\n\n\nThe training continued the next day.\n\n\nWith the training of the past three days, the schedule was somewhat set.\n\n\nIn the morning, do basic exercises such as canter, push-ups, and sit-ups. Jenna copied my workouts exactly. I didn’t even dry it.\n\n\nAfter the basic exercise, weapon skill training begins.\n\n\nSpeaking of weapons training, I wielded a wooden sword and Jenna shot an arrow at a scarecrow. But I didn’t neglect it.\n\n\nIt was because it felt like I was gradually grasping basic techniques such as power distribution and proper posture while swinging. This could be seen by looking at the low-level swordsmanship or shield skill that appeared on the status window.\n\n\nEven so, it would be far short of a knight who had learned formal swordsmanship.\n\n\nYou don’t know if there is an expert who can guide you by your side. At least, I think I can get a sense of something if I do sparring. But I was alone. Since Xena’s main equipment was hardened with a bow, she can’t request sparring.\n\n\nThe other three did not come to the training center.\n\n\nOccasionally, I could see him talking to himself in the corner of the square about escaping rather than looking for an exit.\n\n\nOf course, there was no exit.\n\n\nTwo more days passed like that.\n\n\nJenna and I were facing each other on both sides of the training camp.\n\n\n“Are you really okay?”\n\n\n“are you okay.”\n\n\nI hit the shield with a wooden sword.\n\n\nJenna was holding a bow.\n\n\nI recognized that both Jenna and I needed more hands-on training.\n\n\nFighting with sword and sword was tough, but there were other ways.\n\n\n“Could it hurt?”\n\n\n“You don’t have to die.”\n\n\nThere were a few times when my wrists broke due to over-swinging the sword.\n\n\nThe injured wrist was soon restored to its original state. The waiting room itself seemed to have a healing effect. If you don’t die with a single knife like Mormont, you will be healed naturally.\n\n\nOne of the training methods I organized last night.\n\n\n“Shoot!”\n\n\n“Don’t be resentful!”\n\n\nJenna fired an arrow.\n\n\nright shoulder. I moved my left arm.\n\n\npuck!\n\n\nThe arrow pierced the shield with a dull sound. I drew an arrow and threw it at Jenna. Perhaps it was an arrow for practice, so it was easily pulled out.\n\n\n“again.”\n\n\nThe shooting continued.\n\n\nFor Xena, shooting training against a living opponent.\n\n\nI trained in shield techniques to block flying arrows.\n\n\nOne more condition has been added here. Block arrows with your shield while attacking the scarecrow next to you. It is an exercise in attack and defense at the same time.\n\n\nI changed the attack position while being conscious of it.\n\n\nhead first. Next chest. Then the legs.\n\n\nWhat I do now is similar to drawing a square with my left hand while drawing a circle with my right hand. You have to split your focus in two.\n\n\n“…!”\n\n\nI sat down at the sharp pain that pierced my calf.\n\n\nIt wasn’t an arrow, but it stole a chunk of flesh as it passed.\n\n\n“Gwa, are you okay?”\n\n\n“Don’t mind me.”\n\n\nAfter kneeling down for a while, new skin sprouted from the wound. I stood up and brushed my right foot. It’s okay. could move\n\n\n“You think of another way. The enemies won’t stop like me and will attack you. Do you want to just stand still and shoot?”\n\n\nTo my words, Jenna added a training method.\n\n\nshoot while walking.\n\n\nIt was a moving shot.\n\n\nAs his concentration dropped, the frequency of getting hit by arrows increased. There were times when I died and came back to life. The wound heals, but the pain remains.\n\n\n‘Do I have to do something crazy like this?’\n\n\nNegative thoughts crept up.\n\n\nI didn’t stop It’s good if it hurts. Because it’s proof that I’m alive.\n\n\nStill not enough. I climb the tower Survive.\n\n\nAnd…\n\n\n[‘Han( )"s ‘Lesser Swordsmanship’ has risen to Lv.2!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )’s ‘Lesser Shield Art’ has risen to Lv.2!] [\n\n\n‘Han( )’ has acquired the ‘Pain Resistance’ skill!]\n\n\n‘As expected.’\n\n\nAcquired Pain Resistance, which is said to be an essential passive skill for warriors.\n\n\nIf you raise your pain resistance to level 10, you can evolve it into battle continuation. It is an A-class skill that maintains the hero’s fighting power until the moment he dies.\n\n\nWhat remains is\n\n\n‘calm.’\n\n\nIt is a sub-skill of Combat Logic.\n\n\nIf you raise your composure to level 10, battle logic, if you raise your battle logic to level 10, you get the ultimate skill, Myung-Kyeong Index. If it rises to the level of light, it can prevent any mental state abnormality.\n\n\nIt would be nice to go to the opposite skill, Berserk Combat Madness Berserk, but my strength lies in my wide range of information about Pick Me Up. Berserk, which lost reason instead of increasing combat power, was poison to me.\n\n\nNot to get excited about any situation.\n\n\nObserving the situation calmly.\n\n\nIn the tutorial and the first battle I couldn’t. If this state continues, you will have to ride the berserk tech tree without getting stuck. Calmness and madness were skills that could not coexist.\n\n\n‘Let’s keep this in mind.’\n\n\nAmong the thousands of skills in Pick Me Up, synergy certainly exists.\n\n\nI know what skills need to be combined to create synergy.\n\n\nA few more days passed like that.\n\n\nAmkena hasn’t been online in a while. It seemed busy. The possibility of folding was not taken into account. Even if you do, there are other options. As I expected, so it will be.\n\n\nCut the scarecrow with a wooden sword.\n\n\nBlock arrows with a shield.\n\n\ncutting and blocking. Do not think of these as two actions. It should be tied into one action.\n\n\narrows are flying\n\n\nYou don’t even have to watch it all the way. I raised the shield to where the arrow would come in and stabbed the scarecrow in the neck with my sword.\n\n\nYes, sword and shield are one.\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[Skill Awakening!]\n\n\n[Hero ‘Han( )"s ‘Lesser Swordsmanship’ and ‘Lesser Shields’ are combined to create a new skill.] [\n\n\n‘Han( )’ is ‘Lesser Swordsmanship (Lv. .3)’ has been learned!]\n\n\nA refreshing sensation penetrated his entire body.\n\n\nAs if the sword and shield had become part of the body, a strange sense of unity was felt.\n\n\n“Today ends here.”\n\n\nI lowered my shield.\n\n\nThe wooden shield had become a hedgehog with dozens of arrows.\n\n\nI wasn’t the only one with technology advancing. Zena also gradually imposed conditions on her shooting. Shoot while walking, shoot while running, double fire, etc. Zena’s low-level archery was already level 4.\n\n\nJenna said as she put her bow into her weapon barrel.\n\n\n“But it looks like the Master isn’t coming. What if he doesn’t come back like this? Do I have to stay locked up here?”\n\n\nAnxiety was evident on Jenna’s face.\n\n\nI chuckled.\n\n\n“If you don’t come for a month…”\n\n\n“What if you don’t come?”\n\n\n“Well, you’ll know when you see it.”\n\n\nI put my sword and shield back in place.\n\n\n[Welcome to Pick Me Up!] I heard\n\n\nthat even tigers will come when I say it.\n\n\n[Loading has finished.]\n\n\n[TOUCH ! (Selection)]\n\n\n“You’re here.”\n\n\n“It’s good. I was itchy from training.”\n\n\n“How come you seem to adapt better than me, you?”\n\n\n“I’m a bit bold.”\n\n\nAccording to what I heard during the break, Jenna had lived alone in a remote forest.\n\n\nHer father, who used to come home once a month, died in a fight with a monster a year ago.\n\n\nWhen I came out to the square, Isel was dragging the three of them out of the inn.\n\n\n[I told you to come! When the Master comes, come out to the square. why don’t you listen Do you want to get scolded?]\n\n\nI looked up at the ceiling.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the waiting room has no ceiling. Instead, a whitish gray sky appeared. When the Master enters, this sky will glow in rainbow colors. In addition to messages, you can get information from these indications.\n\n\n“You’re trying to make me fight again? I hate it, I hate it!”\n\n\n“I’ll give you money, too. I have money at home! Send it back! I’m tired of eating only potatoes!”\n\n\n[Ah, I’m going crazy!]\n\n\nIsel exploded.\n\n\nA straight punch like flame exploded from his dainty hand.\n\n\n“Quek!”\n\n\n[Hey, I’m shy, so I’m going to write it down! Come on! aren’t you coming? You all searched today!]\n\n\n[Loading…]\n\n\nAfter a while, the three of them stood in the plaza. Each had blood clots under their noses.\n\n\n[Open the space-time gap!]\n\n\n[Tips/ Heroes who don’t listen, run around. Reactivity increases.]\n\n\nIssel was very determined.\n\n\nA gap in time and space and an arsenal were opened. After taking a shield and a bow, the mirror began to shine as soon as they entered the space-time gap.\n\n\n[Climb the tower and save the world!]\n\n\n[Main Dungeon: Current number of floors to climb – 2]\n\n\nThe light went out.\n\n\n[Floor 3.]\n\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n\n[Goal – Exterminate the enemy!]\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.5 X 4]\n\n\nField type Plain.\n\n\nThis time, the opponents were four goblins.\n\n\n“Kerrrrr!”\n\n\nThe three were armed with swords and shields.\n\n\nThe one behind him was holding a crossbow, not a catapult.\n\n\nThe goblins with swords approached us from the middle left and right respectively. The crossbow goblin was loading a bolt.\n\n\n‘The armament and tactics have improved.’\n\n\nIt is a natural change as the floor goes up.\n\n\nAfter reloading, the goblin aimed a crossbow at me.\n\n\nThat was before I even pulled the trigger.\n\n\nWedge love!\n\n\nAn arrow from behind pierced the goblin’s forehead.\n\n\n“Kack!”\n\n\nThe goblin tripped and died in an exaggerated motion.\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“I told you. I’m useful too.”\n\n\nI just ran away.\n\n\nBefore receiving the joint attack, hit and enter from this side. one first. The goblin crouched down and raised the shield. But there is a gap. I twisted my shoulder and inserted the sword.\n\n\ntwo. He rushed forward with his shield in front. I ran into it and blew it away with a shield. I have the upper hand in height, weight, and strength. I took the gap and cut off the neck.\n\n\none last one.\n\n\nPerhaps he was frightened, he backed away. I approached slowly\n\n\nAn arrow pierced the goblin’s shin. It is the part of the lower body that is difficult to block with a shield. stabbed a sword in the heart\n\n\n[Clear the stage!]\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ level up!]\n\n\n[Reward – 7000G Leather (C) X 1 Iron Ore (C) X 1]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘Jenna ( )’]\n\n\nBonus experience points when selected as the MVP of the battle receive\n\n\nThis time Jenna was the MVP. It seems that the crossbow goblin I killed first had high points.\n\n\n‘Do they still have no intention of fighting?’\n\n\nThe three of them just looked at us with anxious eyes.\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter. I don’t want to share my experience with those guys either. If you don’t contribute to battle, you don’t get experience points.\n\n\nI returned to the space-time gap.\n\n\n“Huh, already?”\n\n\n“It was a bit boring this time.”\n\n\nRather than our enemies being insignificant, we became stronger.\n\n\nYou can feel it. Training was not in vain. The sword and shield moved more smoothly and there was no gap in the action.\n\n\n“Is it over? Then we…”\n\n\nToby hardened as he was about to leave.\n\n\nThe door leading to the plaza was still closed.\n\n\nThe mirror on the left shone.\n\n\n[Selected floor number 1. Do you want to try again?]\n\n\n[Yes / No]\n\n\nIt’s not over.”\n\n\nJenna tightened her bow with a firm expression.\n\n\n“Looks like you’re going to turn the wheel.”\n\n\nIt looks like Isel’s tip was influenced.\n\n\nIf you retry a floor you’ve already cleared, the experience or rewards you can receive will decrease, but cancer Kena seems to have decided that safety is more important than going up one floor.\n\n\n[ Floor 1.]\n\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n\n[Goal – Annihilate the enemy!]\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.2 X 3]\n\n\n“Kerruk!” ”\n\n\nKak\n\n\n!”\n\n\nOne went straight through the head and died.\n\n\nZena immediately fired a second arrow and pulled the string. The arrow lodged in the chest of the goblin, who was staring blankly at the corpse of his comrade.\n\n\nThen, Jenna fired the third string . [Stage cleared!]\n\n\n[\n\nReward – 1000G]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘Jenna( )’]\n\n\n“….”\n\n\n“Heh heh.”\n\n\nThe mirror shone again\n\n\n[Floor 1.]\n\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n\n[Goal – Annihilate the enemy!]\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.4 X 2]\n\n\nAs soon as the location changed, I ran right away.\n\n\nI heard the sound of an arrow cutting through the wind from behind. I hit the arrow with my shield.\n\n\n“What are you doing!”\n\n\n” Noisy, dude!” Do you\n\n\ndare to eat all the EXP by yourself?\n\n\nI slaughtered two goblins without mercy.\n\n\n[Stage cleared!]\n\n\n[Reward – 1000G]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘One ( )’]\n\n\nTwo more battles like that “Is it over?”\n\n\n”\n\nI don’t know,”\n\n\nthe other party member asked, and Jenna turned her head away.\n\n\nThey didn’t do anything for a total of five battles.

How long do I have to go after them?”\n\n\n“Today is the end.”\n\n\n“It’s over. I don’t think there’s any intention to change.”\n\n\n“I don’t think the master has enough room to feed the locusts.”\n\n\n[Start synthesizing the master.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop the hero to be sacrificed to the hero you want to synthesize!
