Are you right for Chloe?”\n\n“Yes….”\n\n“From now on you will cook.”\n\n[Chef recommendation list!]\n\n[‘Chloe(★)’]\n\n[Do you want to appoint ‘Chloe(★)’ as the restaurant’s chef? Existing chefs will have their positions canceled.]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\nThat’s right Issel.\n\nGood job.\n\n“Kee, wait. I’ll make it again!”\n\n“You lie when you don’t know how to?”\n\nOne notice is worthy of praise, but if it’s a lie that will be caught anyway, it’s better not to. The gazes of those in the audience, including Zena, grew cold.\n\nThe stare intensified when Chloe brought the potato dish. Chloe presented a variety of dishes that can be made with potatoes, such as potato salad topped with a refreshing sauce, grilled potatoes with butter, crispy fries, and a warm stew.\n\n“It’s delicious! Potatoes come in so many different flavors.”\n\n“Because there were various seasonings…”\n\nChloe shyly lowered her head at Jenna’s praise.\n\nDolph sat in a corner and said nothing. I said.\n\n“Listen while eating. I won’t tell you twice. Do the same to the newcomers next time what you guys heard today. If you don’t want to see them die stupidly.”\n\nI explained the basic rules of this world to the people gathered at the restaurant.\n\nbeing a master. That we have to do our job to survive. The number of floors increases with each mission and can be released upon reaching the 100th floor.\n\nI thought about it for a while, but he also told me about synthesis. It’s a fact that will come naturally anyway.\n\n“Is that… true?”\n\n“Believe it or not, you guys make the decision. Instead, you take responsibility yourself.”\n\nEven though people were trembling with anxiety, it seemed that they somehow came to terms with it. At least there were no crazed or rampant ones.\n\n“If you prepare hard enough, you can survive.\n\nJenna said in a lively voice.\n\n“Are we doing something else?”\n\nThe young carpenter raised his hand.\n\n“You and Chloe are carpenters and cooks respectively. You can help us in other ways.”\n\n“I, I also work as a carpenter…”\n\n“If the lie is exposed again, shall I recommend you as the first victim of synthesis? I think it will be a good textbook.”\n\nDolph kept his mouth shut.\n\nIt is true that non-combat jobs are more likely to survive than combat jobs, but this is not a place to be at ease. Seats are limited, and there is no guarantee that heroes with better skills will not be summoned. If he is pushed out of his seat, there is only one thing waiting for him. Therefore, even non-combat workers had to constantly hone their skills.\n\n[Are you sure you want to terminate the connection to the master?]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n[Then, goodbye!]\n\nAmkena left the waiting room as if satisfied.\n\nAfter the meal, the rooms of the lodging were distributed.\n\nThis time, I also decided to stay in this place rather than the original room.\n\nThere are signs that Amkena’s access time will increase.\n\nI don’t know if the room is visible to the master or not, but there’s nothing wrong with being careful. I didn’t want to stand out on the strange side.\n\n“Anyway, I didn’t know that you would care about others.”\n\n“How long have you met a person to judge?”\n\n“Because I have a good eye for seeing like this.\n\n“Anyway, this is the last time.”\n\nDue to the pick me up system, it is not possible to climb all floors with a small number of people, so we only took minimal measures. If they don’t all die, I’ll tell the new recruits what to do on their own.\n\nFrom the next day, the monotonous daily life changed little by little.\n\nWhen I woke up at dawn, Chloe was peeling potatoes in the restaurant. My eyes were red from crying so much last night. Not long after, Jenna came out. Except for the three of us, no one was in the lobby yet.\n\nI sighed and headed to the training ground.\n\nThe level 2 training ground is exceptionally wide. If the training ground before was about the size of an auditorium, now it looked like a playground. The scarecrow made by weaving straw bales is replaced with a wooden scarecrow carved from wood. There was also a shooting range for archery and a sandy beach obstacle course.\n\nAt the training ground, Aaron, who arrived earlier than us, was training. He was screaming in the air and firing his spear. Jenna and I followed suit and joined the training.\n\nI solved my lunch with baked potatoes at the training ground and continued training until dinner.\n\nA few people arrived at the training ground, but none joined the training directly yet. I pretended to understand, but didn’t seem to realize it.\n\nAnd the Evening Master connected.\n\nThis connection interval is one day. Compared to the previous interval of at least 3 days, it was greatly reduced. Considering that the time in the waiting room and the Earth are different, it seemed that he logged on during free times such as breakfast and lunch.\n\nThe target of Amkena this time was the newcomers, not us. Aaron couldn’t join the party today either. One did not return.\n\nAs expected the next day, people gathered at the training ground.\n\n“Teach me how to fight!”\n\nThe small-sized boy bent down.\n\nI think the same thing happened a few days ago.\n\nI looked at the new recruits at the training ground. All three were boys of the same age.\n\n‘Yesterday, one person died, so seven people. 5 people minus the cook and carpenter. But only three people gathered.’\n\nI don’t know where the two are.\n\n“I’m tired of fighting Aaron, but I can change the mood.”\n\nI threw a wooden sword one by one to the new recruits who were struggling.\n\n“For now, all of you, go ahead.”\n\nI couldn’t use a real sword against a newcomer, so I also picked up a suitable wooden sword.\n\nThe basic method of training the current weapon skills is to study the skills against the scarecrow and practice them on Aaron. In addition to simply blocking with a shield or slashing with a sword, high-difficulty movements such as spilling with a sword or parrying an attack were also mixed into the training.\n\nNow is the time not only for one-on-one sparring, but also for many-on-one sparring.\n\nIn most situations anyway, I have to deal with multiple enemies. So far, I haven’t been able to do it because of lack of people, but I finally got a chance.\n\nAll three were excitedly beaten. On the way, I put Aaron in because it was boring, but it was the same.\n\n[‘Han (★)”s ‘Lesser Swordsmanship’ has risen to Lv\n\n.\n\nAs if someone injected it directly into my head, I could gradually feel the flow of swordsmanship. This was also a feature of this world.\n\nSeveral days passed again.\n\n“going!”\n\nA boy with a shaved head comes stabbing with a wooden sword.\n\nlightly dodged. Then two other boys swung their swords beside them. I swung my sword wide and slashed both wooden swords at the same time.\n\nThe opponent’s sword was slow enough to cause a yawn, but I was in the same situation a while ago. However, the gap widened. Each time my sword moved, one by one I was knocked out.\n\n“As expected, my older brother is strong.”\n\nsaid Gide, one of the trio of boys.\n\nThe trio of boys refers to three people gathered here. Gide Hansson Deca, respectively. All were under the age of twenty. These kids called me hyungnim, as if I had heard bad things about Aaron.\n\n“It’s because the level is high, dude.”\n\n“A level?”\n\n“You’ll find out soon.”\n\nAll three are level 2.\n\nThe difference in stats with me is at least 7 to 8. It is more than a child and an adult.\n\nHowever, if it was simply the difference in power, it wouldn’t have been so overwhelming. I am also far superior in additional abilities such as body vision and reaction speed. Perhaps it is the effect of agility.\n\nAnd above all, skill.\n\nAn unknown power is correcting my swordsmanship. The cause was, of course, the low-level swordsmanship I had learned. You can instinctively feel where to draw your sword and shield and move your legs and arms.\n\n‘It’s absurd.’\n\nOn Earth, this kind of achievement could never have been achieved with a short period of training.\n\nOn the other side of the training ground, Jenna is shooting an arrow while running. Every time the protest was pulled, a hole was punched in the humanoid target 30 meters away. That guy has already reached the lower archery level 5. The lower dagger skill was also at level 2.\n\nOn the other hand, Aaron is sluggish. I reached spearmanship level 2 a while ago, but haven’t progressed any further. He was the first to come to the training ground and the last to go back to his lodging, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have skills that he doesn’t have.\n\nThe three people in front of me each gained level 1 swordsmanship.\n\nWhen these guys first came, they looked like wilted bean sprouts, but now they are playing as if they are at home. Perhaps because we are similar in age, we even got along by saying that we were older brothers and sisters.\n\nWell, it’s better than squatting like everyone else. A few days have passed, but the remaining two haven’t come to the training center yet. It seemed to be looking for an exit.\n\nAgain, in vain.\n\nNow I don’t even care\n\nDo it yourself.\n\nA few days later, the free 10-year draw was held once more.\n\nI didn’t even have to step out this time. Aaron and the trio took care of it. In particular, Aaron volunteered to participate and greatly reduced the sacrifice of the first battle. Only one person died during the ‘weeding out’ process.\n\n“There are more and more people.”\n\nJenna said while sucking on the candy.\n\nA lollipop made by hardening sugar water, which Chloe made for Jenna who wanted a snack.\n\n“There will be more in the future.”\n\nI was laying my back on the sofa in the lobby.\n\nNow I’m used to staying at the inn. If I don’t think I want to go to my room, it won’t appear when I open the door.\n\nJenna said after biting down on the remaining candy.\n\n“By the way, Master, why don’t you go to the 5th floor?\n\nI knew the words would come out.\n\nIt’s been quite some time since I cleared the 4th floor harpy and goblin section. In the meantime, Jenna and Aaron, the main party, have been destroying only the 4th floor. Other sub-parties were staying on the 1st or 2nd floor.\n\n‘Of course I won’t go.’\n\nThe difficulty level rises rapidly with each multiplier of 5 layers. It was a kind of boss stage concept.\n\nIf you’ve seen Amkena’s strategy, you know that it’s a dangerous act to drive us to the 5th floor like this. Regardless of level or equipment, the number of people was insufficient.\n\n‘I need 2 more people.’\n\nA maximum of five members per party.\n\nCandidates to join our party are probably two of the three. Because he is young, he adapts quickly. There was also the coming and the enthusiasm. Gide laughed and said that this kind of life would be better than eating in the field.\n\nWe’ll see if that thought continues.\n\nThe tutorial for Pick Me Up is over, but\n\nthe actual tutorial isn’t over yet.\n\nTo the newcomer who came in today, Aaron said that as long as he keeps his mind straight, he can survive unconditionally.\n\nSo far. up to the 4th floor.\n\nI know.\n\nHow demonic the difficulty becomes after that. Even after being weeded out and training at the training center, how many times will I die in the future battle… Even I can’t guarantee that I can survive 100%.\n\nThere were countless trap missions with extremely low success rates, such as survival missions, even on the 10th floor or lower.\n\nI didn’t bother to tell Jenna about this.",
