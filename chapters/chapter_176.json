I nodded and Edith took a deep breath and opened her mouth.\n\n\n“I think everyone has seen a scene similar to mine.”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nThere was silence in the audience.\n\n\nMost of the heroes gathered here were 4 stars.\n\n\nFrom Kishasha and Katio, who were 4 stars since they were summoned, to heroes like me and Jenna who started at 1 star and finished their promotion to 4 stars.\n\n\n‘Currently, there are six 4-star heroes.’\n\n\nKishasha Katio.\n\n\nI am Belquist Jenna.\n\n\nFinally Edith.\n\n\nIt was a 4 star listing in Taone.\n\n\nExcept for Edith, everyone belonged to Party 1.\n\n\nAnyway, since the members of the other 2nd party are also scheduled to be promoted, the number of people joining the 4-star ranks will gradually increase as time goes by.\n\n\n“To be honest…”\n\n\nJenna sighed.\n\n\n“It’s amazing. I’m not exactly sure what that means, but I know it’s amazing.”\n\n\n“You mean those people who were crowded around the palace?”\n\n\nBelquist crossed his arms and laughed.\n\n\nJenna continued.\n\n\n“I did just what I was told above, but it must have been meaningful. If I had known it would be like this, I would have taken a closer look.”\n\n\n“I don’t quite understand. Can someone explain? Wasn’t it just enough to kill all the enemies?”\n\n\n“Everything we did was meaningful.”\n\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t have a hobby of solving riddles. It’s just that humans and monsters gathered in a splendid palace, and they ended up squawking among themselves. That means something.”\n\n\nIf you don’t know the context, you may not understand.\n\n\nUntil the 2-star promotion, the story of the past came out, and then suddenly went to a strange place. It would be a bit lacking in hints to figure out the purpose of this world’s existence.\n\n\n“You’re being unkind. If you’re going to tell me, I’ll tell you properly.”\n\n\n“That’s true. Should I say there are a lot of cryptic parts?”\n\n\n“If you don’t know, let me explain step by step.”\n\n\nsaid Nerissa, who was sitting in the corner of the table.\n\n\nShe was the only 3 star among the heroes here. I called because I knew quite a bit about this world and the mission. Nerissa said, clearing her voice.\n\n\n“To put it bluntly, our hometown of Taonier has already been destroyed. And the reason we were summoned here is to undo the past and save Taonier.”\n\n\nBelquist wrinkled his brow.\n\n\n“The sight you see is Taoniar on the brink of destruction. It’s meant to show how this world was created.”\n\n\n“This, this, a little…”\n\n\n“I’ll tell you slowly.”\n\n\nNerissa glanced at me and began to explain.\n\n\nOur hometown, Taoneer, has already been destroyed, and we must return to Taone before it was destroyed and carry out our mission. The heroes summoned to the waiting room are the ones chosen to save the world, and the princess plays a key role in the mission.\n\n\n“Uh, that’s a little difficult…”\n\n\nJenna scratched her head nervously.\n\n\n“I don’t quite understand. Even if Nell-sama is right, I don’t remember making a contract like that. When I came to my senses, it was here.”\n\n\n“From my analysis, it is highly likely that low-level heroes were brought here against their will. High-level heroes seem to be different.”\n\n\n“In the end, you mean you were forced to come here?”\n\n\n“It must be like that.”\n\n\nThe meeting was going on with everyone speaking.\n\n\nIt seems that Jenna and Belquist are not convinced yet. Nerissa continued her explanation by explaining the information step by step in an easy-to-understand manner.\n\n\n“I don’t remember. I’ve never seen that blonde girl before.”\n\n\n“Wouldn’t the memory be released at the next promotion? I think I heard someone’s voice. It’s a very faint memory. It must have been the goddess.”\n\n\nEdith responded calmly to Kishasha’s objection.\n\n\n“Nothing changes anyway. Isn’t it the same as having to wake up to the 100th floor? Taoni language is a bothersome matter.”\n\n\n“Nothing will change. But if this information spreads recklessly, it could cause a commotion to the other residents. We’re going to crack down on ourselves. Han, what do you think? To the people on the lower floors…” ”\n\n\n…. ”\n\n\n“Han?”\n\n\nEdith came to me.\n\n\n“I want to hear what you think. You haven’t said anything since before.”\n\n\n“It is. What do you think? What we saw.”\n\n\nEveryone’s eyes were focused on me.\n\n\nI clicked my tongue and opened my mouth.\n\n\n“I have no idea. Do as you like.”\n\n\n“yes?”\n\n\n“Tell me later how you decided. I’ll follow suit.”\n\n\nI got up from my seat.\n\n\nEdith followed, bewildered.\n\n\n“Where?”\n\n\n“Sorry. I’m not feeling well.”\n\n\nI walked out of the living room at a brisk pace.\n\n\nNerissa and Edith are leading the meeting, even when I’m still.\n\n\nA conclusion will come soon The truth of this world, except for the main combat positions, is unknown, and let’s not inform others. That was the case with the flow of the meeting.\n\n\n‘It’s all old anyway.’\n\n\nWhat I saw I can’t tell anyone.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, this itself was dangerous information. The morale of the heroes will be drastically lowered if they learn that the goddess treats Taonian humans like toys.\n\n\n‘…’\n\n\nI opened the door at the end of the hallway and entered.\n\n\nmy room. He threw himself on the sofa next to the bed.\n\n\n‘It’s annoying.’\n\n\nI want what is so complicated.\n\n\nI don’t know how many times I get hit.\n\n\nThe scene I saw is spinning around.\n\n\n‘I guess I need to organize it.’\n\n\nTo do this, you need a helper.\n\n\nWhen I snapped my fingers, stardust glittered next to me.\n\n\n[Loki’s subordinate No. 1 Isel lampstand!]\n\n\nIsel spun around and sat on my shoulder.\n\n\nI began to unravel the messy information one by one.\n\n\nIsel looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n\n[It’s been strange since a few days ago. What’s wrong?]\n\n\n“I have a question. Can you answer it?”\n\n\n[Gorum! Ask me anything!]\n\n\nIssel pounded on his chest.\n\n\nAnything. Let’s take a look. I smiled and opened my mouth.\n\n\n“I saw something very funny at the luncheon ceremony.”\n\n\n[Yes, the director paid a lot of attention to the 4-star promotion ceremony here. It should be easy to understand because it was specially made for the Taoni language…\n\n\n]\n\n\nIsel backed away in surprise.\n\n\n[What do you mean Loki?]\n\n\n“Answer only yes or no.”\n\n\nAs I was silent, Isel nodded while putting on a bewildered expression.\n\n\n“The purpose of this game is to save the destroyed world, right?”\n\n\n[That’s right.]\n\n\n“The master, the hero, and the waiting room exist for that.”\n\n\n[huh. The mission is the same.]\n\n\nSo far, it’s right with what I knew.\n\n\nThe reason for the existence of this world is to undo the destruction of the world.\n\n\nFor that purpose, there is interference and there is a master and hero waiting room.\n\n\n“okay.”\n\n\n[Suddenly why?]\n\n\nThe real thing was from now on.\n\n\n“Are the monsters in the mission related to the demise?”\n\n\n[…] \n\n\n“Why did we fight them?”\n\n\n[Wait a minute… That’s Taoni…]\n\n\nIsel hesitated.\n\n\nI closed my eyes. The characteristics of the destroyed world that I saw while riding the airship.\n\n\nThere were worlds where everything was engulfed in fire, there were worlds covered by seas, and there were also worlds frozen solid.\n\n\nAlthough their characteristics were different, they had one thing in common.\n\n\n‘No one lives.’\n\n\nIt became a completely dead land, becoming ruins where not even humans could live, not even monsters, insects, and even a single plant. It is destroyed in the true sense.\n\n\nIf the reason the world collapsed was because of the monster invasion, that kind of ending shouldn’t have happened.\n\n\nIt doesn’t make sense that the world itself would perish even if the human species would disappear.\n\n\n“Isel. I know more than you expected. Don’t try to hide it.”\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n“Among the missions I’ve been through, were there those who caused the destruction?”\n\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\n\nIsel, who was shaking, opened her mouth.\n\n\n[No.]\n\n\n“Then why did I do that shit?”\n\n\nIssel looked at me with fearful eyes.\n\n\nIt was a sign of inability to speak. I smiled and pulled out the bifrost.\n\n\n“Use this. You can cover his eyes.”\n\n\nIsel looked around the vicinity of Volsera and put his hand on the blade.\n\n\nBlack energy flowed from the sword and wrapped around Isel.\n\n\n[If you find out about this… it’s really embarrassing.]\n\n\n“It’s okay. I’ll stop you.”\n\n\n[Isn’t that a lie?]\n\n\nIssel looked up at me.\n\n\n“When I’m older. Not long.”\n\n\n[Ah, okay.]\n\n\nIssel took a deep breath.\n\n\n[Loki, did you really see the 0th floor?]\n\n\nIt seems that the place I was in is called ‘0th floor’.\n\n\nI nodded and said.\n\n\n“Yeah. I was good at cheating once.”\n\n\n[If you really get caught, it’s the end. Write haha.]\n\n\nIsel took a deep breath and opened her mouth.\n\n\n[The monsters you’ve fought in the meantime have nothing to do with the destruction of Taoneer.]\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n[They… are heroes of the past.]\n\n\n“Whether they’re human or a different race.”\n\n\n[Yes.]\n\n\nIndeed.\n\n\nIf that’s the case, it means that the ones we’ve been killing for fun are the guardians who once risked their lives to protect Taonier.\n\n\n‘It will be the same for things that will be killed in the future.’\n\n\n“Why did you have to?”\n\n\n[Because there must be conditions to make a game.]\n\n\nIssel continued.\n\n\nThe two goddesses of Moebius created a game called ‘Pick Me Up’ to turn the world destined to perish. To be more precise, to borrow the power of Earthlings belonging to the upper dimension of Mobius.\n\n\n[If there is a hero in the game, there must also be an enemy. So…]\n\n\n“That’s why I turned normal guys into enemies.”\n\n\n[But if you make real enemies appear…]\n\n\n“Isn’t that the opponent?”\n\n\nIssel nodded.\n\n\nI know.\n\n\nWho are the real enemies we have to deal with.\n\n\nRight after the 80th floor.\n\n\n‘I do understand.’\n\n\nIf such guys appear from the beginning, even if the god of the game comes, they will never be able to break it.\n\n\nThen, the purpose of the existence of the monsters before that…\n\n\nI laughed bitterly.\n\n\n“Are they just experience points?”\n\n\n[Monsters are offerings for the level-up of behemoth heroes. It gets damaged in the process of turning into a monster, so it gets in the way of restoration.]\n\n\nIndeed.\n\n\n[When the world belonging to Mobius perishes, the monsters and heroes are determined according to the director’s standards.] I\n\n\nthink I understand.\n\n\nI remembered the scenery at that time.\n\n\nIf they had accepted the offer of the goddess, they could have become ‘advanced heroes’. But nobody accepted. So it became a monster.\n\n\n‘I guess I know the conditions of birth grade.’\n\n\nIt seems that the rank is determined according to the influence of the previous life.\n\n\nThe main characters in that world are of high rank. Those who are close to extras are low grade.\n\n\nThose who consciously or unconsciously agreed with the goddess remain heroes, and those who disagree become monsters.\n\n\n‘It’s completely self-defeating.’\n\n\nI was dumbfounded and laughed.\n\n\nOne thing to know is that all heroes and monsters are puppets.\n\n\njust like the master.\n\n\n‘…’\n\n\nThis would be trivial. He still hides many secrets.\n\n\nThey are deliberately showing only information that is advantageous to them. It was to the point where the god came up. Even with this promotion, it is the same.\n\n\n‘…after.’\n\n\nSuddenly, Freea’s face came to mind.\n\n\nThat guy was just…\n\n\n‘Was it something to throw away?’\n\n\nIt’s not just Pria.\n\n\nEveryone including me was like that.\n\n\nI got up.\n\n\n“Thank you. Thanks for listening.”\n\n\n[Yeah.]\n\n\n“Don’t worry. I won’t do any damage.”\n\n\nWhat to do has not changed.\n\n\nClimbing the tower, dealing with monsters, and getting stronger.\n\n\nAnd when the time comes, return to Earth.\n\n\nBut in the meantime, there was just one more thing to do.\n\n\nnever cared so far\n\n\nI was annoyed at this situation, but it didn’t matter much if I could go back.\n\n\nYou can ignore it after returning to Earth. It’s enough if you leave like an annoyance.\n\n\nI thought so.\n\n\nBut now it’s clear.\n\n\n‘You followed.’",
