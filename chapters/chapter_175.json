End of the World (4)\n\n\nThe girl walked slowly to where everyone was gathered.\n\n\nThe huge shadow behind the girl swayed whenever her small white bare feet stepped on the floor. The shadow was swaying in a dark black color, sucking in the surrounding light.\n\n\n“All of them are just idiots.”\n\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\n\n“The things called heroes. To kick them even if given a chance to make up for it.\n\n\n“What are you! Rude!”\n\n\nA knight came out with a sword drawn.\n\n\nThe girl smiled and reached out to the knight.\n\n\n“omg!”\n\n\nThe knight was pulled up through the air as if by an invisible hand.\n\n\nAs the girl grabbed her hand, the knight was compressed, and fragments of shattered armor and flesh shattered into pieces. The girl wiped her hands and laughed.\n\n\n“I don’t need a dog that doesn’t know its master. Don’t you know?”\n\n\nThe saintess recited quietly.\n\n\n“…Goddess.”\n\n\n“Yes, I am your master.”\n\n\nMembers of the church knelt down in unison.\n\n\nThe girl looked down at the saintess with an expression dripping with displeasure.\n\n\n“I must have given an oracle. Why are you acting on your own?”\n\n\n“It’s just that we…”\n\n\n“There’s no need for excuses. Are you guys still my apostles? I only use them when it’s convenient, and when I want to, they don’t back me up.”\n\n\nThe girl looked back at the heroes standing still.\n\n\n“I, Tell, have made it clear. I will give you a chance to start all over again. But do you dare refuse? Isn’t there a limit to being shameless?”\n\n\n“We are grateful for the grace the Goddess has bestowed upon us. However, we… want to get the ending we want. Please… please give us permission!”\n\n\nThe saintess hit her head on the floor.\n\n\nAt the same time, the priests and paladins next to him also bowed their heads.\n\n\n[Hehehe…]\n\n\nTell grabbed his forehead and let out a burst of light.\n\n\nA distinctive laugh that scratches a person’s temperament head.\n\n\n“Since when has a dog objected to its master’s orders?”\n\n\n“We are dogs…”\n\n\n“Everything you say, the air you breathe, the bread and meat you eat, the ground you stand on, from the hairs of your head to your soul, are all mine. All are my toys. With pride. You’re going to die? Whoever wants.”\n\n\nTell trampled on the saintess’ head.\n\n\nThe saintess didn’t even move.\n\n\n“Taoni shouldn’t end here, doesn’t it?”\n\n\nTell smirked and looked at Pria.\n\n\nPria flinched without a word.\n\n\n“Clean your feet.”\n\n\nThe smile on Tell’s lips disappeared.\n\n\nA young man in a golden coat was walking out.\n\n\n“We admit that the goddess has been gracious to us. But we reserve the right to decide our fate.”\n\n\n“That’s too much to say.”\n\n\n“Go back. Let us meet our just end.”\n\n\nTell glared at the young man.\n\n\n“You’re cheeky.”\n\n\n“This body is a lineage of gold from the beginning of the empire. I think I have the right to say this to the goddess.”\n\n\n“You’re a hybrid of a monster and a human.”\n\n\nAs soon as the word ‘hybrid’ came out of Tell’s mouth, weapons were pointed at him from all directions.\n\n\nTell smirked.\n\n\n“When do you worship, and now you want to kill?”\n\n\n“The Goddess has completely changed. I don’t know what happened, but I won’t tolerate any more tyranny.”\n\n\nI crossed my legs while sitting in a chair.\n\n\nI had already predicted that the person who brought me here was a director and goddess of Mobius. Because there wasn’t just one or two hints. However, this development was quite unfamiliar.\n\n\n‘Was it a confrontational relationship?’\n\n\nLooking at that guy’s actions, it seems that the goddess is not omnipotent.\n\n\nIf it was an infinite existence, it would be enough to return the world with its own ability in a higher dimension. There would have been no need to issue an oracle and ask for consent.\n\n\n‘A miracle requires a price.’\n\n\nJust like the Earth was used to warp Mobius’ space-time.\n\n\nThen, what is the price of this Advent?\n\n\n‘There is only one.’\n\n\nI looked back at Pria. The reason why those\n\n\nwho were once heroes\n\n\nand now have become ‘ghosts’ curse and resent Pria.\n\n\nI sighed.\n\n\n“You won’t accept it?”\n\n\n“Yes. Go back.”\n\n\nTell smiled coldly.\n\n\n“I’m sorry. The contract has already ended.”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“Don’t you wonder how that kid knew about the oracle?”\n\n\nTell pointed at Pria.\n\n\nPria flinched and shouted,\n\n\n“What are you talking about! I never signed a contract with you…” ”\n\n\nThat kid said he wanted to save Taonier at all costs to me.”\n\n\nPria put on a devastated expression.\n\n\nEveryone’s eyes turned to Pria.\n\n\n“Oh no! I never said that! I’m new to that woman!”\n\n\n“You told me you wanted to do it again even if you risked yourself and everything around you.” A\n\n\ncold smile caught on Tell’s lips.\n\n\n“I, the goddess of innocence, ‘Tell’, declare this by betting on my soul. This is the obvious truth.」\n\n\n“Geez, don’t lie!”\n\n\n“You mean you don’t believe me? If you violate this declaration, even I may perish. Don’t you guys know the best?」\n\n\n“Wait… Wait…!”\n\n\nPria hesitated and stepped back.\n\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n\n“Yes, you were sold.”\n\n\nTell smiled mischievously and raised his left hand.\n\n\nA thick shadow began to unravel from his left hand.\n\n\n「Those of you who have given up on the challenge do not deserve to be heroes. Become a sacrifice for true heroes.」\n\n\n“What… What are you talking about!”\n\n\n“Games need enemies. I want it to be an experience point.”\n\n\nTell spread his left hand.\n\n\nThe shadows grew in an instant and began to swallow the people in the hall one by one.\n\n\nThere was no time to scream. The translucent shadow stuttered, engulfing everything both human and non-human.\n\n\nExcept for Pria.\n\n\n“You were chosen to be the protagonist of Taoni. You can be proud.”\n\n\n“No, I…”\n\n\n“There are hardly any good hero candidates. I’ve eaten this world too I’m afraid I’m going to die from being\n\n\nbothered.”\n\n\nThe people swallowed by the shadows vomited blood.\n\n\nBlood black as tar. Dark red blood vessels sprouted over their skin.\n\n\n‘Is it contaminated?’\n\n\nKurur.\n\n\nThe shadow that spread like jelly came to me too.\n\n\nA shadow began to climb under my feet.\n\n\n[Danger!]\n\n\n[‘Han(★★★)’ starts to get contaminated!]\n\n\nI snorted and pressed down the shadow with the scabbard.\n\n\nKwajik. Black blood gushed out and the shadow withdrew itself.\n\n\n‘It’s contaminated.’\n\n\nHeroes who have seen the truth seem to deal with it this way.\n\n\nIt was the cause of the reinforcement failure. I feel bad. I looked ahead with a frown on my face. A conversation between the two was going on.\n\n\n“Any hero should be able to throw everything in order to achieve his goal. Isn’t that right, Prisis?」\n\n\n“No… No! Don’t lie!”\n\n\nPria cried out and shook her head.\n\n\nHer neat, clean face was a mess of tears.\n\n\n「Admit it. You sold them out.」\n\n\n“Lies! Lies!”\n\n\n“It’s not a lie,”\n\n\nTell laughed innocently and then went over to Pria and whispered in her ear.\n\n\n“It was like that in a dream.”\n\n\n“Wait, that, that’s…”\n\n\n“Hehe…”\n\n\nPria sat down with a dejected expression.\n\n\n‘You said you signed a contract with the words you said in your dream?’\n\n\nKwajik!\n\n\nI trampled on the creeping shadows.\n\n\nIt looks like this place is about to collapse too. On the other side, an elliptical dimension door shimmered.\n\n\n“Let’s see.”\n\n\nTell pulled out a ledger from the side of Pria, who was sitting down, and unfolded it.\n\n\n“Taonier. One 5-star candidate and three 4-star candidates for high rank. It’s quite a shame. The mongrel bastard blew a nuisance. It’s ruined here as well.”\n\n\nTell, who was turning over the ledger with an expressionless expression and recording something, turned his gaze somewhere.\n\n\nThe young man engulfed in the shadows was staring at Tell while half-kneeling.\n\n\n“I should have accepted that. If I had signed a contract with you, the chances were much better than this berth.”\n\n\nTell kicked down Pria.\n\n\nThe young man opened his mouth, but no sound came out.\n\n\nTell smirked.\n\n\n“Am I resentful?”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“Then become stronger. Fight against the hero. Become the strongest enemy and devour the world. There may be a possibility.”\n\n\nIt seems that the limit has come.\n\n\nShadows were gathering one after another.\n\n\nI moved in the direction of the dimension door.\n\n\nKurung.\n\n\nThe palace was collapsing.\n\n\nRemnants of broken pillars blocked the way.\n\n\nI lightly jumped over and walked to the portal.\n\n\n‘…well.’\n\n\nThere are still many unknowns.\n\n\nWhat I saw here is only part of the truth.\n\n\nBut…\n\n\n‘There’s more than one dirty thing.’\n\n\nto the point of vomiting.\n\n\nI continued walking towards the portal.\n\n\nThe landscape around him blurred and begun to twist. Tell, Pria, and those who were eaten by the shadows also disappeared one after another. It was the end of this world.\n\n\nWheein.\n\n\nThe dark red sand wind brushed my cheeks.\n\n\nI narrowed my eyes. The surrounding landscape had suddenly turned into a desert.\n\n\ndark desert. A red fog hovers.\n\n\n[Floor 80.]\n\n\nOver the desert horizon.\n\n\nsomeone is standing\n\n\nHe was glaring at me while wearing a pitch-black cloak.\n\n\nA face covered in fog. Dark red eyes flashed.\n\n\n[Black Prince]\n\n\n[Praios all Ragnar]\n\n\nThe shiny blonde hair is painted over with thick black.\n\n\nAt first glance, the skin exposed under the cloak was tightly wrapped in dark red bandages. like a mummy\n\n\nThe golden eyes had long since lost their brilliance. There was a shady aura in the eyes of the sunken man.\n\n\n‘Are you a big fan?’\n\n\nThe 80th floor of Taoni.\n\n\nWe will meet soon.\n\n\nA level slowly floated beneath the bastard’s name tag.\n\n\n[Lv. 354]\n\n\nA bitter laugh came out.\n\n\nEstimated level is in the mid 300s.\n\n\nIt was a level comparable to 7-star heroes.\n\n\n80th floor.\n\n\nThe real hell begins.\n\n\nIf the difficulty was similar to Niflheim, I expected it to be this much.\n\n\nI continued walking through the dark red fog.\n\n\n‘…I’m sorry.’\n\n\nI don’t consider your circumstances.\n\n\nAnyone who stands in my way will be beaten to death.\n\n\n“Wait… wait…”\n\n\nA ghostly tone flowed from the bandaged mouth.\n\n\nI looked back at him.\n\n\n“Yes, wait. I’ll make you feel at ease right away.”\n\n\nA dimensional door is swinging right in front of me.\n\n\nI glanced back at him and stepped over the door.\n\n\nA cool sensation ran through my body.\n\n\n[Bara night!]\n\n\n[Congratulations, Master!]\n\n\n[Hero’s Forgotten memories are awakened.]\n\n\n[‘Han (★★★★)’ promotion complete! It has reached 4 stars.]\n\n\n[Illustration is updated.]\n\n\n[Level and skill thresholds are increased.]\n\n\n[Hero’s first imprint will be released.]\n\n\n[Tips/What is Imprint?]\n\n\n[This is a hero’s special ability that can be obtained through Advent Dungeon.]\n\n\n[Essential condition to become an excellent hero! A well-made imprint is as good as ten skills. Grant it. Don’t forget!]\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes,\n\n\nthe red magic circle at the promotion center came into my field of vision.\n\n\nA slight headache was ringing in my head.\n\n\nI grabbed my forehead and came out to the square.\n\n\n“Oh, oppa. Congratulations!”\n\n\nJenna rushed over.\n\n\nIt seems she’s been waiting since I entered the promotion center.\n\n\n“With this, oppa gets 4 stars. There is nothing to be ignored. Anyway, if you attack my brother, it’s all one shot.”\n\n\n“….”\n\n\n“Brother?”\n\n\nJenna blinked and looked at me.\n\n\n“What’s wrong? Your expression is scary. I think it’s going to eat people.”\n\n\n“Eating people. What are you talking about?”\n\n\nI smiled and walked up the stairs.\n\n\nJenna trotted after me.\n\n\n“You’re next. Be prepared.”\n\n\n“A word from an experienced person! Do you have anything to prepare for the 4-star promotion? They say it could fail.”\n\n\n“That’s…”\n\n\nBoom!\n\n\nI punched the wall.\n\n\nJenna was startled and backed away.\n\n\n“Brother?!”\n\n\n“There’s a bug. ”\n\n\nI went up the stairs.\n\n\nA hologram window was shining where I punched.\n\n\n[※Caution – GM dedicated line]\n\n\n[There is an unconfirmed chat message.]\n\n\n‘There is no negotiation with you.’",
