If we each talk about what we know, we might get valuable information. I’d like to start with a self-introduction, but does anyone have a different opinion?”\n\n\nThe audience was silent. The man gave a satisfied laugh and opened his mouth.\n\n\n“Let me introduce myself first. I’m Lyle. Forty-four. I run a carpentry shop in Edora. I have a wife and two daughters. I don’t remember why I came here… I’m sorry, but you do it next. would you?”\n\n\n“Greet. Thirty-two years old. I worked as a street vendor in Halsea. I don’t know why I came here either.”\n\n\nThe people started introducing themselves in a clockwise direction.\n\n\nThey were of different ages and occupations. merchant. woodcutter. Carpenter. blacksmith. coachman. grass. Butcher…. \n\n\nPeople introduced long-lost professions as livelihoods. They wore clothes of crudely woven leather and fabric and uttered names they had never heard of before.\n\n\nIssel said I was from Taoni. I don’t know why, but the clothes I was wearing when I came here were similar to them, not sweats.\n\n\nUnlike Shay, they seemed completely unaware of the current situation.\n\n\nIn any case, the predictions were correct.\n\n\nThese people are not Earthlings. It appeared to be from the continent of ‘Taoni’ that Issel said. It seems that humans live there too, but the state of civilization seems to be far behind that of Earth. Of the 11 people, I was the only one from Earth.\n\n\nThe introductions of the people gathered in the square were all over.\n\n\nAll I could tell from their self-introduction was that they knew nothing. Lyle asked how many times he remembered how he got here, but no one did, including himself.\n\n\n“This is embarrassing…”\n\n\nLyle stroked his beard and put on a troubled expression. However, as if it was always like that, he patted his palms to ventilate the crowd before speaking.\n\n\n“Shall we take a look around this place? It can be dangerous if you go alone, so 4, 3, 3, pair up like this…” [What are you talking about,\n\nold man!]\n\n\nAlso appeared.\n\n\nIsel whirled above us, sprinkling stardust.\n\n\n[Because it looks like the Master is going to open up the space-time rift, prepare for a fight!]\n\n\n“You, you…?”\n\n\n[I am Issel. The fairy who manages this place! Don’t mess around if you don’t want to get hurt.]\n\n\nA man stepped forward.\n\n\nMy eyes lit up. That man’s name is Mormont. He is the only one among us with two stars. It is said that he was a mercenary before he came. He wore old but leather armor and wore a proper sword at his waist.\n\n\n‘Status window.’\n\n\nI muttered while looking at Mormont.\n\n\n[Mormont Carl (★★) Lv. 1(Exp 0/10)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 14/14]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 10/10]\n\n\n[Stamina: 12/12]\n\n\n[Agility: 12/12]\n\n\n[Possessed Skill: Lesser Swordsmanship (Lv.1)]\n\n\nThe initial stats aren’t bad. I have 10 intelligence, which is useless except for wizards. It was much better compared to 1 star starting with 10 in all stats.\n\n\nsaid Mormont, who stepped forward.\n\n\n“Did you summon us?”\n\n\n[What to do!]\n\n\nSerung.\n\n\nPeople held their breath at the sharp sound of metal rubbing. Mormont drew his sword and aimed it at Isel.\n\n\n“I’ll make you vomit it all up!”\n\n\nMormont screamed and thrust his sword.\n\n\nIt was a stab with quite a bit of momentum.\n\n\n[‘Mormont (★★)’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n[Sudden death!]\n\n\n[Cause – Suicide due to stress]\n\n\n[Tips/Heroes get tired, depressed, or panic. Reduce your stress level! Give your hero a place to rest and play. Sudden death of unknown cause can be prevented.]\n\n\nFluff.\n\n\nMormont’s body disintegrated after losing his head.\n\n\n“Ah ah ah ah!”\n\n\n“What, what! Dead? Dead chaff! What, this!”\n\n\n[I told you not to mess around if you don’t want to die. If you just listened carefully to what I said, nothing like this would happen. If you touch me, I will die. It’s justification. Got it?]\n\n\nAs Isel swiped his right hand, drops of blood splattered. With that fern-like hand, he smashed the adult man’s head at once.\n\n\nSuicide due to stress?\n\n\nWhere do you see that, suicide?\n\n\n“Uh,, Ue eh!”\n\n\nA few people with weak stomachs fell on their stomachs and vomited.\n\n\nI feel sick to my stomach as well. There is a human corpse right in front of you.\n\n\ngritted it\n\n\nI desperately corrected the reason that seemed to be broken.\n\n\n[Form a party.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop heroes!]\n\n\n[‘Lyle ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Lanto ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Marlene ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Celkerd ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Saxony ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n‘It has begun. ‘\n\n\n[Open the space-time opening!]\n\n\nThe gate in front of the plaza opened with a bang.\n\n\n“Eh, what happened to this. What happened!”\n\n\n“Calm down! Calm down! Calm down first! Now, what did you call us for? If you want something, just say it!”\n\n\nLyle stuttered and asked Isel.\n\n\nIsel said while clearing her ear canal with her index finger.\n\n\n[You want it? Listen to me, fight well and win well. All right. Easy?]\n\n\n“Yes, yes, what should we do?”\n\n\n[Come out of the person whose name was called. Rylanto Marlene Calckard Saxony!]\n\n\n“Me, me?”\n\n\n[If you want to be like him, don’t come out.]\n\n\nIssel pointed to the headless corpse.\n\n\nThe five of them came out somehow, even though they hated it.\n\n\n[Now, take your turn. See that door? Go in there.]\n\n\n“Wait!”\n\n\nI said.\n\n\n[Is it you again! Why again this time!]\n\n\n“You want to climb the tower too, right?”\n\n\nIssel’s expression crumpled.\n\n\nIt seemed to hit the mark. If it wasn’t for that, there’s no need to be so angry when Shay is synthesized. I would rather have laughed at it.\n\n\n[What about that?]\n\n\n“Have the master draw a weapon. We’re 1 star. We don’t even have basic weapons. You don’t intend to send a suicide squad either.”\n\n\n[That’s… that’s right. Wait, wait!]\n\n\nIssel suddenly disappeared.\n\n\n[Master heroes have no equipment.]\n\n\n[How about summoning equipment for smoother battles before leaving for an adventure?]\n\n\n[Tips/Heroes without weapons enter battle holding an old iron sword (F). Place your equipment in the Armory and the heroes will equip it for you. Of course, you can also designate a lifted weapon. Prepare your equipment. Don’t forget!]\n\n\nOne more assumption was correct.\n\n\nISELL could interfere with system messages.\n\n\nFollowing Issel’s guidance, Amkena entered the summoning station and immediately began summoning.\n\n\n[Summon equipment]\n\n\n[Summon an item.]\n\n\n[Summon 1 time – 5000 gold]\n\n\n[Summon 10 times – 50000 gold]\n\n\n[\n\n\nMaster starts summoning equipment 10 times\n\n\n.\n\n\n] Master ‘Amkena’ has learned the ‘Iron Sword (E+)’!] [\n\n\nMaster ‘Amkena’ has learned the ‘Crude Bow (E-)’!] \n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ has… .]\n\n\nLyle came to me.\n\n\n“Hey, hey, I said Han. Do you know anything about this place!”\n\n\n“I’ve only just arrived, so I don’t know. If there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s that Ultada can die. So, everyone.”\n\n\nI pointed to the open armory door and said.\n\n\n“You’d better get your weapons out of there. It’ll start soon.”\n\n\n“What starts?”\n\n\n“battle.”\n\n\n“Did you say battle, battle?”\n\n\n“You can stay there if you don’t like it.”\n\n\nI went into the arsenal.\n\n\nVarious weapons were stuck in the old showcase. These are things that Amkena got from the 10-game equipment draw. Iron Sword Bow Mace Pike. There were several types.\n\n\nSoon after, a good number of people entered the arsenal.\n\n\n“Hey, can I pick out a weapon here?”\n\n\nA middle-aged woman asked me with anxious eyes.\n\n\nI nodded.\n\n\n“I-I don’t know anything like fighting! I didn’t even fight when I was young!”\n\n\n“Choose first. Choose and think!”\n\n\n“This is mine!”\n\n\nThe nine of them started rummaging through the arsenal.\n\n\nThe highest tier weapon is that one. I looked at the mace that Lyle was holding dear. At the end of the mace was a barbed iron ball.\n\n\n[Morning Star]\n\n\n[Grade D+]\n\n\nLyle trembled when my eyes met. They seem to think I’m going to take it. I laughed and turned my back.\n\n\ndon’t worry. don’t take\n\n\nI heard the equipment in the corner of the arsenal.\n\n\n[Crude wooden shield]\n\n\n[Grade E+]\n\n\n‘There was.’\n\n\nI was nervous about what would happen if I didn’t come out.\n\n\nWhen the level and stars are low, what equipment increases survivability the most when the hero is not used to fighting. This is one of the tips I got when developing several sets of 1 stars.\n\n\nThe ones with the highest probability of surviving were those with shields.\n\n\n[Out of the arsenal! Because it starts now!]\n\n\nIsel groaned in the plaza.\n\n\nEach person picked up their own equipment and came out of the arsenal. Mormont’s corpse and bloody vomit in the plaza were completely gone.\n\n\n“What is this?”\n\n\n“Is it magic?”\n\n\n[It’s noisy, did you call it earlier? Rylanto Marlene Calckard Saxony! five like this. Go through that door!]\n\n\nThe five people who were called entered the door hesitantly. As Isel followed him inside, the gate slammed shut.\n\n\nsilence.\n\n\nThe other four stand idly by.\n\n\nI was sitting near the gap in time and space, examining the shield. Whether it is not broken or punctured and whether it can block the enemy’s attack properly.\n\n\nNo problem.\n\n\nIt was a crude shield carved out of an oak tree, but it would easily block a goblin’s sword or catapult.\n\n\n“Do you know what will happen to your brother?”\n\n\nA girl with a bow came up to me.\n\n\nRed long hair and freckles. He was one head shorter than me, and his skin was tanned brown.\n\n\n“A little bit.”\n\n\n“What about us? Why do we need weapons? Where else are we? What is that fairy?”\n\n\nIt spits out questions like a rapid-fire cannon.\n\n\nThat’s why I tried to pretend I didn’t know. It wasn’t specifically for them that I intervened earlier. It was to increase my chances of survival. Mormont, a professional mercenary, is dead, and the remaining four don’t look particularly good at fighting.\n\n\nGail, an old coachman who has driven only carriages all his life.\n\n\nGreet, a street vendor who has never fought with a friend.\n\n\nPork mincing, doubtful whether it will be able to run with a lot of fat.\n\n\nAnd this cheeky girl, Jenna.\n\n\n‘This is why I’m a 1st person.’\n\n\nIf you’re unlucky, you might die on the first floor.\n\n\nI answered roughly.\n\n\n“Soon we’ll go into the battlefield. All we have to do is kill all the enemies there. I don’t know much about the rest, so think on your own.”\n\n\n“A battlefield?”\n\n\nI closed my mouth.\n\n\nJenna inquired several times after that, but I didn’t answer. Finally giving up, Jenna leaned against the wall and sat down.\n\n\n[‘Marlene ( )’ returned to the arms of the goddess. Her fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nIs she already dead?\n\n\nThe monsters that appear on the 10th floor and below are goblins at most.\n\n\nI wanted to see the battle scene, but the video doesn’t appear. The system reported only the outcome of the battle.\n\n\n[‘Kelkerd ( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n[‘Ranto ( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\nCould it be annihilated on the first floor?\n\n\n[‘Saxony ( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n“What is it, is something going on?”\n\n\n“Be quiet.”\n\n\n[‘Lyle( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n[‘Party 1’ has been wiped out.]\n\n\n[You Lose!]\n\n\n“…."\n\n\n[You useless bastard!]\n\n\nIssel appeared in the square and stomped his feet. The face was flushed.\n\n\nI was also a bit dumbfounded.\n\n\nIt’s not easy to get wiped out on the first floor. It may be the words of the master who blew away the rare hero he picked for free. If Shay had been there, he would have handled it all by himself.\n\n\n[Form a party.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop heroes!]\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!] [\n\n\n‘Dazil ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Great( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Gail ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\nOut of 11 heroes 6 people died, 5 people remained.\n\n\nHere, the Master had three options.\n\n\nPaid summons with 500 gems obtained as a tutorial reward. A 3-star or higher hero will appear, and with that ability, you can clear the first floor without difficulty.\n\n\nBuy a training center with two 500 gems and reinforce the heroes before putting them in.\n\n\nJust put the three remaining 1 stars.\n\n\n[Open the space-time!]\n\n\nI think it’s the third one.",
