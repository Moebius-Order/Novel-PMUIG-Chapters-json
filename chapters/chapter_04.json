[‘Han( )’ is out of panic!] Oh no! don’t fight And I don’t know if it’s a dream or not, but I’m going to break the face of the guy who sent me here. I took a deep breath. I took several deep breaths. When his stomach still didn’t settle, he bit his tongue hard. The bitter taste of blood came out. grasp the situation. figure it out where this is what to do. You can think of the reason later. After waking up from the dream, you can slowly look around. “Then…” I looked around. burning houses. downed minga. Residents fleeing. The goblins are chasing after them. I’ve seen this scene somewhere before. not as much as seen I can still vividly recall it. Pick me up. This was the prologue stage of Pick Me Up. Burning Village Fields. Although much more realistic and detailed, this was the ‘background’. It’s like the back picture of a play. The other side cannot interfere here, and the here cannot interfere there. why me! It calmed down the negative thoughts that were creeping up. You can vent your anger after waking up. I swung the iron sword in my right hand once. My right shoulder ached from the weight. one little one. In the background, there are hundreds of goblins in the village, but there is only one goblin in the ‘field’. The rest should be treated as non-existent. At the bottom of the hill, a goblin wearing a helmet rolled down his eyes. Blood dripped from the blade. “Keruk!” “If you’re going to make it, make it a little rough…” The graphics aren’t good enough. Pick Me Up is a mobile game. Absolutely no graphics. The fangs at the corners of the mouth and the bumpy bumps on the skin of the red eyes. red blood. why is it so realistic [‘Han( )’ feels fear! All stats are reduced by 30%.] [Tips/Heroes with low Fear Resistance often feel fear. Be careful.] Even if you have a bold personality, if you drop it in a place like this and tell it to fight a monster with a sword, it can’t be scary. At least, let’s hear K-2 or shoot a gun! Even standing still, my legs tremble. My eyes widened and my breath caught up to my chin. Hot breath escaped from his mouth. Will it hurt if I get hit by that knife? If I die here, will I die in real life? Or wake up from a dream? “Damn it…” I have no intention of testing it. ‘Cause it hurts so bad I spat bloody saliva. The goblin’s size is smaller than me. At least about middle school students. The limbs were also thin and slender. In terms of muscle, it won’t be that strong. Whether you are an elementary school student or a middle school student, if you get hit with a knife, you will go to one room. Also I’m on top of a sloping hill with goblins below. The terrain is advantageous this way! “You son of a bitch!” I ran up the hill and kicked. The goblin in the lead was kicked in the chest and rolled down. The goblin rolled over and swung his sword. don’t be nervous don’t blink watch till the end! If you can’t see it, you’ll fall behind! As I took a step back, a blade grazed in front of me. A cold block of ice landed on my chest. if only it was a bit late “I’ll cry!” He threw the iron sword. The sword hilt made a ting sound as it hit the helmet. The goblin staggered. I jumped right in and attacked him. Me and the goblins blended together and collapsed. “Look around, you bastard!” I took a mount position and slapped the goblin in the face. With both knees pinning his shoulders, he punched his nose with his fist. There was a thud and the goblin’s nose sank. Blood spurted out. It’s like your head is on fire Mounted on the goblin, I punched like crazy. I forgot about the iron sword. Do your best in each room. My fist broke and I punched. a few minutes to do so. “Ha ha ha…” I fell sprawled away from the goblin. The goblin, covered in blood, wriggled slightly before stopping. [Stage cleared!] [‘Han( )’ level up!] [Rewards are given. Please check the mailbox.] Once again, the view swung around. When I opened my eyes, I was in a white room. Fatigue had disappeared without a trace. There were no scars all over the body. A messy dance arose. Instead of fatigue, a feeling of lethargy came over me. [Before proceeding to the next stage of the master, shall we select a colleague? Touch the ‘Summon’ tab in the menu! First special service! We will give you 500 gems for 1 Advanced Summon.] [Talkak Durururu.] [Too Kwakakang!] [Isell: No, this feeling?!] [! !Super! !Rare! !] [Master ‘Amkena’ has acquired the hero ‘Shay (★★★★)’!] What is this message again? no way. I opened the door and came out into the square. Among the iron doors that were firmly locked, the door to the ‘Summoning Center’ was open. crazy crazy Are you really summoned? [Master is lucky! Check out the chosen hero. Please touch the ‘Hero’ tab in the menu.] I entered the summoning station door with trembling steps. A black magic circle is engraved in the middle of the large room. A female knight was standing on top of it. After a while, part of the field of view flashed and an ability window appeared. [Shay Radasteri (★★★★) Lv. 1(Exp 0/10)] [Class: Knight] [Strength: 18/18] [Intelligence: 10/10] [Stamina: 16/16] [Agility: 20/20] [Possessed Skill: Combat Logic (Lv.1) Intermediate Sharpening (Lv.1) Knight’s Attitude (Lv.1)] The knight had his eyes closed while wearing fancy plate armor that looked like something out of a movie. The silver rapier hanging from her waist caught the light and flashed. The female knight opened her eyes. “Have you been summoned?” The female knight muttered in a low voice and stepped out of the magic circle. She threw her eyes at me, who was standing there. “you?” “Ha, Han Seo-jin.” “Han Seo-jin? That’s a strange name. I’m Shay Radasteri. I’m a knight.” Shay replied nonchalantly and left the summoning station. This is not the time. I brushed my hair and followed Shay. Shay was looking around in the center of the plaza. “Hmm, is this a place like this? I understand.” Shay nodded knowing what she knew. Every time I walked, the joints of my armor made a clicking sound. He didn’t even show the slightest interest in me. [Shall we form a party with the summoned heroes? Create your own party by dragging and dropping the heroes from the Hero Box into the party composition slot!] [‘Han( )’ and ‘Shay(★★★★)’ have become a party!] Your head spins quickly. It’s full of incomprehensible things, but a few things are clear. This window that keeps popping up in front of my eyes is a message output by Issel, the fairy who is conducting the tutorial for ‘Pick Me Up’. It was a long time ago, but I remember it. Also, I am not the one who controls the current waiting room. The hologram cursor moved on its own and selected a menu. And the fact that the battle with the goblin I just went through was the first battle to inform the tutorial of Pick Me Up. Each floor of the tower is a random stage, but if there is only one fixed stage, it’s a tutorial. The tutorial always features a burning village and goblins. Then this place… Dogish. It was the worst possibility. [After forming the party, let’s sortie!] [Start the second mission!] Once again, the view reversed. When I opened my eyes, a familiar landscape was reflected on my retina. burning town. people running away. A group of goblins swarmed from the bottom of the hill. When I reached back, I touched a transparent wall. It was the same as not being able to get out. The only difference is “bugs!” Shay pulled a sword from her waist and lifted it. The awl-like tip of the sword shone sharply. There wasn’t just one goblin. “Keruk, Kerr, Kerr!” At the bottom of the hill, as many as five goblins were approaching. Eyes as red as blood came out and captured the female knight alternately. In my hand is a blunt, old iron sword. Moreover, unlike Shay, who is dressed in a stylishly dressed leather-clad plate armor, he is wearing a loose shirt and pants. Why is that woman a saber with plate mail and I am an old iron sword! “You’re a beginner. Your posture isn’t good.” “Because it’s the first time!” Can not help it. Shay was different from me, who was standing there awkwardly. He turned his left hand behind his waist and aimed the dagger in his right hand at the goblin. The slightly bent lower body holds strong elasticity. Even as a beginner, it was a neat posture. The goblins spread out in open formation and approached. When he reached the range, he immediately swung his sword. If it’s one person, I think I’ll be able to do it somehow with the last method, but if it’s five people… what should I do? The right number doesn’t come to mind. “Kyao!” A goblin in the lead came running. Lean but muscular arms wriggle. The blood-soaked knife was swung. Shay, who bolted like lightning, deflected her sword and plunged it into the goblin’s throat. Immediately, blood gushed out of the punctured hole. The smell of blood wafting up my nose made me dizzy. “Kyarrleuk!” “It’s weak!” Shay spilled the goblin’s knife and pierced the uvula with a sharp sword. one at a time. Neither the limbs nor the torso. The sharp sword was inserted precisely into the narrow gap less than 5 cm in diameter. It was an amazingly frightening feat. Can I bruise like this for a second? Before I knew it, three goblins were lying on the ground. All I did here was watch. When this battle is over… What a dog! I rushed forward with an iron sword. After killing the fourth goblin, Shay stepped aside. “I won’t leave one to you.” Leave it and go to sleep! After this fight, the last step of the tutorial awaits. If you ask what to do in the last step, you synthesize a hero. It is the process of consuming a hero and raising the experience of another hero. And right now, the only people in the waiting room are Shay and me. breathing quickens It felt like every muscle in my body was screaming. What is more terrifying than the goblin’s sword being swung at my face is the result immediately after the battle is over. A dream? Where is such a real dream! As I leaned down, a few strands of my severed hair fluttered. I burrowed into the goblin’s arms and stabbed the iron sword deeply. A dull touch pierced the meat. The smell irritated his nose. The heat from the surroundings cooked the hot spot under the skin. The throbbing of the intestines pulsating beyond the point of the knife, and the realization that a life had been killed were vaguely felt. [Stage cleared!] [‘Shay (★★★★)’ level up!] [Rewards are given. Please check your mailbox .] [MVP – ‘Shay (★★★★)’] Returned to the plaza. [The master heroes did a great job fighting. The last tutorial is waiting for you. Synthesize how to strengthen your hero! Open the door!] [Touch the ‘Synthesis’ tab in the menu.] Quivering. The door to the synthesis was opened. ‘It’s X.’ Let’s think soberly. This place is identical to the initial structure of the waiting room in Pick Me Up, except that the graphics are made in real life. I don’t know why, but I woke up in a place like this. The game was installed and the tutorial started. [Hey you!] I heard a voice that seemed to pierce my brain. I looked up. A girl the size of a forearm was flying through the air. Two pairs of dragonfly-like wings fluttered behind the girl in the black dress. [Don’t you go in quickly? Master is waiting!] The girl pointed at me. A girl with black hair in pigtails. Round features and cheeks that didn’t lose breast meat. I’ve seen this look before. “…Isel?” [Yes, I’m Issel… not you, how do you know my name?] Of course. Because I did this tutorial. [Anyway, go to the synthetic lab! There is a limit to waiting.] “What will happen if I go?” [I’m going to synthesize.] Shay can’t be seen, probably because she entered the synthesis center first. I was standing alone in the square. I cried. “I’m not going, damn it!” }}",
