The black flames surrounding the blade had also disappeared.\n\n\nI opened my eyes wide and looked ahead.\n\n\nThe collapsed palace was back to its original state as if it had never happened.\n\n\nThe surface of the table was the same. Even the blond young man of the highest rank, the surrounding head of households, the leaders of the different races, the religious leaders, and even Pria in the corner.\n\n\n‘The front and back are correct.’\n\n\nBut there are unanswered questions.\n\n\nThe sight I just saw cannot explain it.\n\n\nAbove all, my senses, which I had built up over and over the line of fire, were fiercely ringing the alarm bell. You should have been hit with the water quite a bit. It can’t be this peaceful.\n\n\nChijik. tooth support.\n\n\nThe noise that was blocking my view dissipated.\n\n\nI sat down once again in an empty chair at the table.\n\n\n“I don’t accept this ending!”\n\n\nLet’s see what’s going on…\n\n\nPria stands up and speaks with enthusiasm.\n\n\n“Let’s all enjoy dinner together and finish it here? Funny sound! Our warriors are still bleeding outside!”\n\n\n“So… what are you going to do? Her Highness the Princess.”\n\n\nHmm. is this part\n\n\nIt doesn’t seem to have changed much.\n\n\nThat’s it for now.\n\n\nWith my hands on the table, I listened to the conversation that followed.\n\n\nThe flow of the argument is not different from what we just saw. Pria is furious, and the female mage and the old knight stop her. He said that there was no other way, so he had to accept it. And Pria speaks again.\n\n\n“There’s one… way left.”\n\n\nPria’s eyes turned to the saintess.\n\n\n“Saint, hasn’t the goddess’ oracle come down? I heard that there is an important clue to save the continent. But why are you keeping it a secret?”\n\n\nI looked at the saintess on the left side of the table.\n\n\nA young girl wearing a pure white robe with the church’s pattern and a light purple cape.\n\n\nThere is a calmness in her expression that does not match her appearance.\n\n\nThe subsequent flow was similar.\n\n\nThe knight objected, saying that the saintess could not hide the oracle, and Pria gritted her teeth and said.\n\n\n“I’m not mistaken. I’ve heard clearly. The Goddess said she’d give us one chance… a chance to start all over again.”\n\n\n“Your Highness, what are you talking about?”\n\n\n“It’s going back in time. Back a few years.”\n\n\n“Turn back time.”\n\n\n“If we go back then, the outcome might be different. Isn’t it unfortunate to sit down like this? You mean to end it without knowing anything, not even knowing the identity of the enemy? I don’t understand. If there is a way even with a very low probability, shouldn’t we try .”\n\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n\n“The goddess gave such an oracle… that’s right.”\n\n\n“Why did you hide it?”\n\n\n“It’s…”\n\n\nIs it from here?\n\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\n“Pria.”\n\n\nHowever, it was not the saintess who spoke next, but the young man in the upper seat.\n\n\nPria glared at the young man.\n\n\n“Your brother didn’t know either, did you?”\n\n\n“I knew it. I knew it.”\n\n\n“Then why…!”\n\n\n“Do you know what to give up?”\n\n\nalso.\n\n\nA different development emerged.\n\n\n“If I could truly save it, if I could save our empire and our continent, would I have hesitated? Answer me. Did I… look that ridiculous?”\n\n\n“but!”\n\n\n“It’s true that the oracle came down. I received an offer to return time.”\n\n\nThe young man crumpled his sculptural face.\n\n\n“For one chance, can you push all life on the continent into the pit of hell?”\n\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n\n“Your Highness, there is a price.”\n\n\nThe saintess shook her head.\n\n\n“Our Goddess is not a perfect Creator. To perform miracles, such tributes and restrictions are required.”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“I saw.”\n\n\nThe saintess bit her lip.\n\n\n“To become someone’s plaything, to see us suffering forever, unable to live or die. The intact continent will be torn apart, and the past and future will lose their meaning. It’s just enslavement.”\n\n\n“That, that…”\n\n\nIt becomes someone’s toy without dying or living.\n\n\nThe past and the future lose their meaning and suffer infinitely.\n\n\nI remembered the monsters trapped in the tower. No matter how many times you kill them, they come back to life. It becomes a valuable nutrient for the hero’s experience. After all, it was the same with the heroes.\n\n\nIn the end, they were just toys for monsters, heroes, and masters.\n\n\nBecause it’s just a game.\n\n\n“Pria.”\n\n\nThe young man looked at Pria with a soft expression.\n\n\n“I understand you. So do I. How can I not be angry? I have built up a lot of blood and sweat, but in the end, it ends like this… How can I accept it easily?”\n\n\nThe young man closed his eyes.\n\n\n“Nothing is eternal. We humans, other races, empires, this continent, and even the universe. If there is a beginning, there is an end. The end comes from our generation.”\n\n\n“….”\n\n\n“For a moment of self-satisfaction, let’s not wager a gamble with everything as collateral.”\n\n\nPria didn’t say anything.\n\n\nShe sat back in her seat with a distorted expression on her face and bowed her head.\n\n\n“So… you mean to end it like this?”\n\n\nA voice mixed with sobs came out.\n\n\n“The people of the empire, the lives of different races, our children…”\n\n\n“Who would understand, Her Highness the Princess?”\n\n\nThe old man next to the young man said.\n\n\nThe name tag has the words ‘Lantia’s family head’ written on it.\n\n\n“I want to save it if I can. But if I do that, what will become of the many warriors who have given their lives for the continent so far? They may have been defeated, but they have not lost their pride. This pride is the only thing we can take with us.” . Moreover, His Highness the Prince.”\n\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n\n“You’re not going to end it like this, are you?”\n\n\nThe young man grinned.\n\n\n“Of course. We also have something called pride. Shouldn’t we blow the last shot and go?”\n\n\nThe young man stood up from his seat waving his golden coat.\n\n\nGolden eyes were shining like the sun.\n\n\n“We will clearly show them that we were once here, that we lived fiercely every day, and that we did not lose our pride until the day we died.”\n\n\n“Right! Wait, Prince!”\n\n\nThe Beast King clenched his fists and stood up.\n\n\n“Persene! What is the situation below? All the women and children must have escaped safely, right?”\n\n\n“Yes, we evacuated them all.”\n\n\n“Close the main gate of the basement. Until the very end, we will fight.”\n\n\nThe young man raised the golden sheath.\n\n\n“We will not die in peace! Our flesh will be torn, our bones broken, our intestines and brains will stain the floor. But to the last one, we will show them our will. Do you agree with me? Are you ready to die together, with the Taoni we loved?”\n\n\n“I will follow you to the end.”\n\n\nThe three family heads knelt side by side.\n\n\nAfterwards, the saints and paladins of the church deeply bowed down.\n\n\nThe leaders of the different races laughed heartily.\n\n\n“What could be a better death than this? Anyway, we die someday. Then, do you want to die living as a crippled old man in a closet? Or do you want to die as a hero who will go down in history? Answer me, human! Would you die in pride!”\n\n\nThe atmosphere has changed.\n\n\nThe expressions of the humans and monsters who were trembling with fear near the table began to change.\n\n\nThe shivering goblins pulled out their daggers and the ogre grabbed the ax with both hands. A human knight drew a spear knife and a lizardman waved his staff.\n\n\n“Don’t be afraid. I’ll die first. I’ll clean up the heroes’ path to the underworld.”\n\n\nthud!\n\n\nAs soon as the young man finished speaking, the whole palace shook greatly.\n\n\nThe sorceress called Persene bowed her head to the young man.\n\n\n“The Asinis Knights have just been annihilated.”\n\n\n“It’s our turn next. Let’s get ready.”\n\n\nThe meeting is over.\n\n\nThe quiet palace was filled with various noises.\n\n\nThe soldiers and monsters checked their weapons and armor, and the knights read their words and set up a charge formation. Mages refined their rites, and priests bestowed blessings on warriors.\n\n\n‘Is this how it happened?’\n\n\nIt seems that these people were not as small as the false Pria had called them.\n\n\nNo one trembles with fear. A light of fighting spirit flashed in each of their eyes.\n\n\n“My dear little sister, Pria.”\n\n\nWhile everyone was busy preparing for battle, the young man approached Pria, who was crouching in the corner.\n\n\nPria sat in the corner of the table, her shoulders trembling.\n\n\n“I’m sorry. I couldn’t relieve you of your resentment.”\n\n\n“…No, Your Highness the Prince.”\n\n\n“You’ve come this far, Your Highness? It’s hard. Call me oppa.”\n\n\n“That, that’s…”\n\n\n“There are only two of us left, are you going to call me the prince until the end?”\n\n\n“Then brother…”\n\n\n“It’s much better.”\n\n\nThe young man grinned.\n\n\nThe young man looked over at Pria’s tear-stained face and wrapped her arms around her.\n\n\n“If I hadn’t been in this position, I would have felt the same way as you. Actually, I don’t care about pride. I’d sell my soul to the devil if I could save it, if I could get the chance. But I can’t. I can’t. Understand. will you give me?”\n\n\n“…yes.”\n\n\nThe young man looked around with a playful expression and whispered in Pria’s ear when he confirmed that no one was there.\n\n\n“By any chance, if the anger doesn’t go away until the end… it’s okay to accept the offer.”\n\n\n“yes?”\n\n\n“I always support you.”\n\n\n“What are you saying…!”\n\n\n“Your Highness, I have something to report.”\n\n\n“Come soon.”\n\n\nThe young man smiled at Pria, who was standing bewildered, and followed the adjutant.\n\n\nLeft alone, Pria looked at the young man’s back with a bewildered face.\n\n\n‘It’s not long.’\n\n\nThe vibrations in the palace are intensifying.\n\n\nThe door leading to the outside shook and rattled.\n\n\nA fierce end after a final struggle. It was a dramatic episode that often appears in movies.\n\n\nI sat down and waited for the banquet to end.\n\n\n‘He’s more suited to the main character.’\n\n\nIf that young man had been the main NPC in Taoneer, it would have been much easier.\n\n\nI glanced over at Pria, not complaining. Pria was still sobbing with tears hanging from her golden eyes.\n\n\n‘I sold it. witch. betrayer.’\n\n\nI recalled the various accusations and curses that had been spat upon Pria.\n\n\nLooking at the current situation, it doesn’t seem like they sold it. The majestic attitude of the first time to Pria is nowhere to be found. Now, only the image of a weak girl remained in that guy. It seemed that he had already given up.\n\n\n‘If you’re a real hero.’\n\n\nI looked at the young man.\n\n\nWhile carrying out her mission, she listened casually to Pria. He is the second heir to the throne, and there is a separate legitimate heir. I guess that’s the guy.\n\n\n“Your Highness the Princess.”\n\n\n“Stop it. Now I won’t even mention the oracle of the goddess.”\n\n\nSome people went to see Pria, but Pria answered dumbfounded and kept her mouth shut.\n\n\nPria, too, was fixing the blade, perhaps intending to follow the young man.\n\n\nAnd the time has come.\n\n\nThe young man in armor Standing in the center of this red carpet,\n\n\nsurrounded by a chaotic mix of different races and genders, with eyes shining brightly,\n\n\nthe young man drew his sword with cold eyes.\n\n\n“This is our last battle. Let’s show the end that we are not ashamed of.”\n\n\nNo one opened their mouths.\n\n\nThey just raised their weapons.\n\n\nPria was also among them.\n\n\n“Thank you for your patience,”\n\n\nthe young man whispered to Pria.\n\n\nPria closed her eyes without saying a word\n\n\n. !Thump!Thump!\n\n\nThe silver gates of the palace began to shake.\n\n\nStone chips and splinters of wood splattered and hollowed out all over the door.\n\n\nThe young man raised his sword.\n\n\n“This is our final battle!”\n\n\n“Oohhh!\n\n\n” All Taonian troops! Stone…”\n\n\nBefore the young man stretched out his sword.\n\n\nBoom!\n\n\nThe goddess statue behind the throne was smashed out of nowhere.\n\n\nA shadow appeared from the thick dust.\n\n\nI sighed. I\n\n\nguess so.\n\n\nIf it ends here.\n\n\nHere If it had been the end, the game would not have started.\n\n\nI wouldn’t have fallen into this world and had to go through all sorts of hardships.\n\n\n“Assault.”\n\n\nA gloomy voice spread throughout the palace. A\n\n\nmuddy and terrifying tone, as if scratching the chest from the inside.\n\n\nThis voice I had heard of it,\n\n\nand it was still deeply etched in my mind.\n\n\n“Whoever wants it?\n\n”",
