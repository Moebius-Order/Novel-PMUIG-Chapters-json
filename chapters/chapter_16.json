Building internal stability (4)\n\n\n[Gid Hanson John Teddy Nawat!]\n\n\nThe people whose names were called flinched.\n\n\nA man with a beard came out and said.\n\n\n“Calling them to a place like this and doing this and that without explanation, isn’t it morally too much?\n\n\n“Oh, that’s right!”\n\n\n[Oh yeah?]\n\n\nIssel said with a sad face.\n\n\n[If you go in there, monsters will appear. We just have to fight them and win.]\n\n\n“What? Why do we have to fight monsters! That makes sense!”\n\n\n[This is why I didn’t like it!]\n\n\nIssel grabbed the man’s wrist and blew it into the space-time gap. People breathed in vain at the monstrous power emanating from the small body.\n\n\n[You have two options. go in quietly Or fly to me!]\n\n\n“Fighting a monster, no matter how much…”\n\n\nThe three entered the space-time gap hesitantly.\n\n\nThe door closes.\n\n\nIt will feel unreasonable. Being summoned without knowing why and fighting a monster for nothing. I know how absurd and unfair this is. It would have been nice to have been given at least some time to prepare.\n\n\nThere is a term called ‘cutting out’.\n\n\nAs one of the pick me up techniques, it is the simplest way to classify a usable one star. The method was really simple.\n\n\nThe freshly picked 1-stars were paired like that and sent to the dungeon.\n\n\nIf you do that…\n\n\n[‘John( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess! His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nIn this way, heroes who do not adapt to the situation are filtered out on their own.\n\n\nThe number of challenging floors is probably one.\n\n\nOn the first floor, there are several young goblins armed with old knives. It was the lowest of the lowest rank monsters. Even if you know nothing about a 1-star level 1, you can overcome it if you calmly deal with it.\n\n\n[‘Teddy ( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess! His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nIf you are unlucky, the entire party may be wiped out as in the first 10 draws, but the death notification message is no longer displayed.\n\n\n“Mo, fighting a monster…”\n\n\n“I can’t do that! I can’t!”\n\n\nA man who was sitting on a bench kicked off his seat and stood up.\n\n\nIsel, the supervisor, has entered the space-time gap and has not been seen. The man began walking away from the plaza at a brisk pace.\n\n\n“You can’t go.”\n\n\nJenna blocked the way.\n\n\nThat guy was also the type to go through hardships.\n\n\n“Why? Why should I?”\n\n\n“If you go out here, what will they do?”\n\n\nNear the space-time gap, three men and women gathered in one place and were trembling.\n\n\n“It’s none of my business. Fight and search for it! I’ll run away.”\n\n\n“At least let’s run away together!”\n\n\n“Leave it alone. I can’t run away anyway.”\n\n\nThe man passed Jenna and pulled open the door to the inn. Doesn’t open. This time I pulled the door of the training center. It’s locked. Neither this door nor that door allowed a man to enter.\n\n\n“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”\n\n\nThe man started banging his head against the wall.\n\n\nShortly thereafter, two survivors returned. Both were young boys, with ghostly pale faces. Isel recited the list of the next party in a calm voice.\n\n\n[Dicca Deckard Siegler Chloe!]\n\n\n“Hee!”\n\n\nThe woman whose name was called knelt down. Aaron, whose eyes were tightly closed, stood up and approached them.\n\n\n[What are you? It’s not your turn, so get out of here.]\n\n\n“I’ll fight with you!”\n\n\n[What?]\n\n\nIsel widened her eyes.\n\n\nBoth me and Jenna were surprised.\n\n\n“That oppa, was he originally like that?”\n\n\n“People say you have to look twice.”\n\n\nI said with a smile.\n\n\n“Isel, recommend Aaron as a party member. He’s still lacking in actual combat, so it’s not bad.”\n\n\n[But…]\n\n\nIsel looked at Aaron and me alternately for a while, hesitated, then disappeared.\n\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ wants to join the ‘Party 3’. Do you allow it?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Tips/Sometimes a hero wants to fight. They will demonstrate higher combat power in that battle.]\n\n\nIf I or Jenna had applied, it would have been rejected. This was only possible for Aaron, who was only level 2 and could gain experience even on the 1st floor.\n\n\nAaron said, holding the hand of the crying woman on her knees.\n\n\n“If you keep your senses and rely on each other, you can live well enough. Don’t worry.”\n\n\nAaron turned the spear behind his back once.\n\n\nIt is an armed demonstration that I can protect you guys. I almost missed it by twisting my wrist on the way, but they didn’t seem to see it. A deep relief appeared on their faces.\n\n\n“Aaron.”\n\n\n“Yes, brother.”\n\n\n“It’s good to help. But don’t set a precedent like me.”\n\n\n“All right.”\n\n\nAaron nodded.\n\n\nIt seemed that he understood the meaning of my words. Aaron took the four of them and went into the space-time rift. The door is closed.\n\n\n‘All that’s left are those guys.’\n\n\nI checked the status window of the young man who was said to be a former carpenter.\n\n\nThere is a skill called low-level carpentry. The carpenter was also right. If you place it in a carpentry shop, it will do its job.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the bald man is diligently sweating and paying attention to his surroundings. When our eyes met, he abruptly looked away.\n\n\n“Ah, I want to go back and eat~”\n\n\nJenna, sitting on the chair, patted her legs.\n\n\nI hit my head.\n\n\n“Why are you hitting me?”\n\n\nI don’t know if you notice or not.\n\n\nThe two survivors of the first battle were building statues to die for. Jenna glanced over there and said.\n\n\n“You’ll get better if you eat a good meal and rest well, right?”\n\n\n“Oooh, waeek!”\n\n\nOne of them, who was clutching his mouth, started to vomit.\n\n\n“Hmm. You’re emptying your stomach to eat a lot.”\n\n\nThe other survivor standing next to him twisted his face.\n\n\nJenna whispered softly in my ear.\n\n\n“It’s a success.”\n\n\n“what?”\n\n\n“You laughed.”\n\n\n“…is that?”\n\n\n“I laughed, sure.”\n\n\nJenna whistled like she didn’t know anything.\n\n\nAaron’s group has returned.\n\n\nno casualties. 5 people went and all 5 people came back. I said.\n\n\n“Aaron, how many goblins have you dealt with?”\n\n\n“One person.”\n\n\n“good.”\n\n\nI understand your intentions.\n\n\nI checked the status windows of each of the four people. Each level rises one step at a time. It means that you participated in the battle somehow.\n\n\nBy precedent I mean the first battle when Aaron came. At that time, it was just the two of us fighting, and the three of us just watched from behind. Eventually, the two of them headed for the synthesis.\n\n\nI knew their future, but I didn’t have the confidence to convince them, and I didn’t feel the need.\n\n\nIn that respect, I didn’t even know that Aaron had a different talent from me.\n\n\n“Is today’s schedule over?”\n\n\n[I think it’s over for a while…]\n\n\nIsel blurted out his words.\n\n\nThe space-time gap is closed, but the light of the sky is not turned off.\n\n\n“Then let’s go back.”\n\n\n“Yah-ho!”\n\n\nJenna got up first and ran towards the dorm.\n\n\nAaron approached me with a worried face.\n\n\n“Brother, the sky is still bright…”\n\n\n“I’m watching you.”\n\n\nAs God watches over the world.\n\n\nJust like a lord inspects the city.\n\n\nThey are observing the process and results of what they have created and cultivated. Our voices are not heard. The conversation doesn’t even come through. This waiting room where we are is passed through dozens of layers of filters, and most of it is omitted, and only a small part is passed on to the master. Even so, this game will already feel like another world to him.\n\n\nI also couldn’t forget the excitement at that time.\n\n\n“Are you going to hang out there all day?”\n\n\nI said to the newbies who were squirming around behind me.\n\n\nThey hesitated, but followed.\n\n\nJenna entered the dorm through the open door.\n\n\nJenna was slumping on the leather couch. He pounded it with his fist and inhaled the smell of the cushion.\n\n\nFor now, I decided to leave him alone.\n\n\nThe house was more spacious.\n\n\nThe living room, the first place you come to when you open the door, is expanded enough to be called a lobby. Even with 11 people, I didn’t feel cramped. There was a soft carpet on the floor and a warm light from the fireplace.\n\n\n‘Certainly, the facilities have improved.’\n\n\nI headed to the restaurant inside the lobby. A large dining table and chairs are installed between the neat interior cabinets. Further inside was the kitchen. Various cooking utensils such as kitchen knives and ladles were seen in the showcase.\n\n\nI opened the cupboard below.\n\n\nIn addition to potatoes, there is a bottle with seasonings such as salt, sugar and butter. There were also several types of fruit, such as apples and grapes.\n\n\n‘Is the stock still potatoes?’\n\n\nWell, it’s better than a side dish of baked potatoes.\n\n\nIt will get better over time. When the daily dungeon opens, you can get cooking ingredients yourself.\n\n\nback to the lobby\n\n\nI said to the man who was sweating exceptionally.\n\n\n“You said you could cook, right?”\n\n\n“Yes, but…”\n\n\n[List of recommended chefs!]\n\n\n[‘Dolph ( )’]\n\n\n[Do you want to appoint ‘Dolph ( )’ as the restaurant’s chef?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nJust in time, Amkenado had the same idea. seems to have done\n\n\nA message came to mind appointing a manager for the facility.\n\n\n“From now on you will be responsible for our meals.”\n\n\n“Chae, responsibility?”\n\n\n“Why, don’t you like it? If you don’t like it, go out and fight like the other kids.”\n\n\nDolph’s complexion turned pale.\n\n\nHe shook his head. Dolph also saw in the square that the two had not returned.\n\n\n“Dinner for 11 people. Is that possible?”\n\n\n“Yes, I will try.”\n\n\nDolph staggered into the kitchen.\n\n\n“Finally out of the baked potato!”\n\n\nJenna, who was rubbing on the sofa, let out a cheer.\n\n\nI looked at the sky again. He still seemed unwilling to close the connection. Because of this, I can’t go back to my room. When I open the door of the inn, a different place appears. I didn’t want to show Amkena a nuisance.\n\n\n“Hyung-nim, isn’t it time to talk to you soon?”\n\n\n“I was going to do the same. I heard that dinner is being prepared just in time, so you can do it while eating.”\n\n\nWhen there are more people, there are a few things you need.\n\n\n‘Give me the watch.’\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ wants a ‘clock’ in the dorm. Do you want to install it?]\n\n\n[3000 gold will be consumed.]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nA grandfather clock appeared in one corner of the lobby.\n\n\n“Hick!”\n\n\nThe woman who saw the scene gasped.\n\n\nI checked the current time. 6:45 in the evening. It’s just the right time.\n\n\nI said.\n\n\n“Gather at the restaurant. I will explain the rules of this world.”\n\n\nThey also need a minimal explanation.\n\n\nThe waiting room was never a place to return to on its own.\n\n\nWe each took our seats at a table in the dining room, and after a while Dolph came out with food.\n\n\nIt was a baked potato.\n\n\nJenna wrinkled her brow.\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ expresses dissatisfaction with the cooking.]\n\n\n“Ash, this was the only ingredient.”\n\n\nI peeled a potato and took a bite.\n\n\nIt was a familiar taste.\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ is dissatisfied with the cooking.]\n\n\n[Tips/If there are many heroes dissatisfied with the cooking, get ingredients for cooking or replace the chef.] He\n\n\nsighed.\n\n\nI wondered, but it was the same. There was no cooking skill in Dolph’s status window. Just because you don’t have the relevant skills doesn’t mean you can’t unconditionally, but it doesn’t seem possible.\n\n\nI saw a woman silently peeling potatoes. Even if you hit it well, you’re in your early 20’s. She has long black hair braided back. The name displayed on the status window is Chloe. The cooking skill is attached to the bottom row.",
