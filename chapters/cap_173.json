World’s End (2)\n\n\nShe was sitting curled up in the corner of the table.\n\n\nShe wore a golden crown on thin silver hair and was wearing a white silver dress.\n\n\nI narrowed my eyes.\n\n\nI’ve seen it several times. I couldn’t figure it out.\n\n\nUntil a few days ago, we met face to face.\n\n\n‘Pria.’\n\n\nHer appearance was very strange.\n\n\nTears welled up in his golden eyes, and he bit his lip so hard that blood gushed out.\n\n\nwhat’s so embarrassing\n\n\n“…ha.”\n\n\nI sighed and put my butt in the empty seat.\n\n\nI sat cross-legged and looked around slowly.\n\n\n“Even though we were defeated, I have no regrets. Everyone did their best and each did what he could. We united beyond class and race differences and fought with one body and one mind.”\n\n\nThe young man’s speech continued.\n\n\nSome people at the table were moved to tears.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nA moan flowed from Pria’s lips.\n\n\nI moved my gaze across the table. Behind the seat of power without an owner, there were twin statues of goddesses made of marble. Two girls holding hands. The appearance of one of them is deeply etched in my mind.\n\n\nI smiled.\n\n\nIn fact, his true identity is not obvious.\n\n\nIt was predictable and there was no need to sleep.\n\n\n‘Did they say they are twin goddesses who rule the Taoni language?’\n\n\nI knew from Nerissa.\n\n\nThe two goddesses are called ‘Tell’ and ‘Ikar’ respectively.\n\n\nIt was said that the saintess would directly receive the oracle from the goddess.\n\n\nI crossed my arms.\n\n\nThe eyes of the goddess statue, which should have been nothing more than a decoration, are shining red.\n\n\nBut few seemed to notice.\n\n\nEveryone was absorbed in the young man’s speech.\n\n\nthud!\n\n\nThe whole palace shook greatly.\n\n\nPieces of stone fell from the ceiling and smashed part of the table.\n\n\n“I guess I’m running out of time…”\n\n\nThe young man laughed bitterly.\n\n\nThe knight standing next to the young man said.\n\n\n“According to reports, they will come to the palace within an hour.”\n\n\n“That means we have only so much time left.”\n\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n\n“No. We all did our best. Who’s to blame?”\n\n\nAs the young man stroked his shoulder, the knight bowed his head deeply as if thrilled.\n\n\nWell, if you look at it from the outside, it’s a heartwarming sight.\n\n\n“It’s ugly.”\n\n\nA sinister voice as if scratching the inside of the ear.\n\n\nI looked across the table. A place where no one used to be. Suddenly, the shadow wriggled and weaved a figure.\n\n\n[SS▩SH黑⊙∈※ Lv.999]\n\n\n「How do you feel?」\n\n\nThe girl with ebony hair looked at me and smiled.\n\n\nIn the low-saturation landscape, he exudes a definite presence.\n\n\n“It’s been a while since I’ve seen it in person like this. You’ve lived this far. You’re truly a master I’ve marked.”\n\n\nTell laughed softly.\n\n\n“Why did you come out? I hate to see you.”\n\n\n“I’m sorry. I barely made time while preparing for the event.”\n\n\n“Go, little.”\n\n\nTell drank from a wine glass filled with a thick, tar-like liquid.\n\n\n“Isn’t it ugly, Loki? They lost.\n\n\n“….”\n\n\n“Everyone except one is garbage. Not worth saving.”\n\n\nTell stroked the cheek of Pria sitting next to him in a sensual motion.\n\n\nPria crouched down as if she didn’t feel anything.\n\n\n「Hehehehehe…」\n\n\nAfter laughing coolly once, Tel’s body turned into a shadow and scattered.\n\n\nI slumped my back in the chair. The young man’s words continued.\n\n\n“Do you have anything to say? Anyone is welcome. If you have something to say…”\n\n\nFria raised her hand.\n\n\nat the same time.\n\n\n‘Hmm?’\n\n\nWoo woo woo woo.\n\n\nBifrost began shaking violently.\n\n\nAs I grabbed the scabbard, the vibration stopped shortly thereafter.\n\n\n“My precious little brother\n\n.\n\n\nFria spoke again and again.\n\n\n“I don’t want to end here.”\n\n\nThe atmosphere in the crowd hardened.\n\n\nbang!\n\n\n“Listen everyone!”\n\n\nPria jumped up and slammed the desk.\n\n\n“Have you been running with blood and sweat just for this end, for this end? ”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n“I’m not angry… I’m not angry!”\n\n\nFria shouted as if screaming.\n\n\nThe atmosphere at the table, which had been calm, changed to a chilly one.\n\n\nThe smiles disappeared from everyone’s faces.\n\n\n“Look at the faces of the people behind you. They are afraid. They are afraid. But are those who lead them give up without letting go of their hands? Aren’t you ashamed of your ancestors!”\n\n\n“How arrogant! How dare you say something safe! No matter how golden you are…!”\n\n\n“Shut up!”\n\n\nPria was furious.\n\n\n“I don’t accept this ending. Let’s all enjoy dinner here and then finish it? Funny sound! Our warriors are still bleeding outside!”\n\n\n“So… what are you going to do? Her Highness the Princess.”\n\n\nThe female mage wearing a purple robe laughed.\n\n\nOn the name tag above his head, the words ‘the family head of Stenberg’ appeared.\n\n\n“It’s not that we weren’t indignant either. But no matter what method we tried, it didn’t work. In the end, it ended up like this. So, what does Her Highness want to do? Are you saying to cry and run wild?”\n\n\n“I also understand Her Highness’s feelings. However, there were results that could not be helped. Sometimes, I think we need to accept it. That is our last remaining pride.”\n\n\n“There’s one… way left.”\n\n\nFria, who had been silent, spoke.\n\n\nHis gaze turned to the church on the right side of the table.\n\n\n“Saint, hasn’t the goddess’ oracle come down? I heard that there is an important clue to save the continent. But why are you keeping it a secret?”\n\n\nThe white-clad girl called the saint was silent.\n\n\nThe female knight next to me said.\n\n\n“Your Highness the Princess, the saintess doesn’t carelessly hide the goddess’s oracle. You may be mistaken.”\n\n\nVersace in a silver flash.\n\n\nIt was the woman I cut off the torso with my own hands yesterday.\n\n\nPria shook her head at Versace’s words.\n\n\n“I’m not mistaken. I’ve heard clearly. The Goddess said she’d give us one chance… a chance to start all over again.”\n\n\n“Your Highness, what are you talking about?”\n\n\n“It’s going back in time. Back a few years.”\n\n\nEstimates are coming in slowly.\n\n\nI thought I knew why I was showing this scene.\n\n\nHe is telling the heroes the purpose of their mission.\n\n\n‘Then…’\n\n\nAre the heroes to be promoted next to see a similar scene?\n\n\nIt was only natural that his attitude changed after the promotion. Of course, you’ll have to wait until the end to make a decision. It wasn’t enough to clear up the doubts that still piled up.\n\n\n“Turn back time.”\n\n\nThe female mage’s eyes narrowed.\n\n\nPria looked around the crowd and continued.\n\n\n“If we go back then, the outcome might be different. Isn’t it unfortunate to sit down like this? You mean to end it without knowing anything, not even knowing the identity of the enemy? I don’t understand. If there is a way even with a very low probability, shouldn’t we try .”\n\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n\nThe beast king’s bewildered eyes turned to the saintess.\n\n\nThe saintess let out a deep sigh.\n\n\n“The goddess gave such an oracle… that’s right.”\n\n\n“Why did you hide it?”\n\n\n“That’s…”\n\n\nThe saintess’ complexion turned pale.\n\n\nEventually, when the mouth tried to open again, it clicked.\n\n\nMy vision blurred with noise. However, the noise disappeared within seconds and the saintess spoke up.\n\n\n“Even if I start over, would that change the outcome?”\n\n\nThe saintess’ voice rang softly.\n\n\n“Wouldn’t it be better to end it like this…?”\n\n\nThe saintess’ tone lowered.\n\n\n“All the races of the Taoniers joined forces as one. And yet, and yet, just once! We couldn’t win just once… Are you going back?”\n\n\nno one objected\n\n\nEven the young man at the head of the table had his eyes closed.\n\n\n“We’re tired now. We think it’s good to end here.”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nA heavy air settled down.\n\n\nI tried to organize the flow of the conversation with my pods on.\n\n\nThese are the guardians who tried to protect Taonier.\n\n\nhuman monster. Regardless of race, they gather in one place. We all fought together, but it seems that we couldn’t even use the side and hit it. And now, facing destruction, they gather in one place and await death.\n\n\n‘It seems to be understandable.’\n\n\nThere is no major discrepancy.\n\n\nIf a 3-star hero comes in and watches, anyone will nod.\n\n\nI said it was ugly\n\n\nI chuckled.\n\n\nIt is.\n\n\nJudging by the current video,\n\n\nthey were frightened.\n\n\n“…dastardly.”\n\n\nFria murmured.\n\n\nA fire broke out in his golden eyes.\n\n\n“You think you can’t win? Let’s end it like this? Don’t be funny. Don’t be funny! Your people are watching! What the hell are you talking about!”\n\n\nPria kicked off her chair and stood up.\n\n\nThe white jade face turned red.\n\n\n“At one time, I thought you were true heroes. I think I was mistaken. You were small people. There is no better small people! Aren’t you ashamed? You should be ashamed!”\n\n\nSreung!\n\n\nPria drew her sword.\n\n\n“Why is no one standing up with me? Even if the probability is very low, even if it’s like a thread, if there is a way, shouldn’t it be? Why is no one saying anything!”\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nNo one opened their mouth.\n\n\n“I will do it. I will do it. A hundred times, a thousand times! I will go back and change it. Even if my body is broken and torn, if it can save the people… I will!”\n\n\nhey\n\n\nThere are no heroes.\n\n\nPria looked at the goddess statue behind the throne with burning eyes.\n\n\nThe silver blade was aimed at the goddess statue.\n\n\n“Goddess, if you are watching, respond! I, Priasis all Ragnar, will accept the offer. If no one else goes, I will go back alone!”\n\n\nWhoops.\n\n\nThe twin goddess statues began to shake.\n\n\ncreak. The lips of the goddess made of marble parted, and a mysterious voice flowed out.\n\n\n“Priasis, the heir to gold.”\n\n\nIt wasn’t an unpleasant voice that irritated my eardrums.\n\n\nIt was a clear tone, like the wind blowing through the forest.\n\n\n“At this moment, the contract has been established.”\n\n\n“For them…”\n\n\nFria turned around the table with a cold expression.\n\n\n“Give me the end befitting my vessel.”\n\n\n“Hey wait! Her Highness, what are you talking about!” The twin goddesses\n\n‘\n\n\nfaces turned toward the table.\n\n\nA red light flashed in their eyes. ”\n\n\nCurse those who don’t deserve it\n\n.”\n\n\nHe clutched his chest and sat down.\n\n\nThe man groaned in pain and spat out a handful of dark red blood. It started with him. Those who had not made a sound at Pria’s screams collapsed one by one and began to vomit blood.\n\n\n“Golden heir, I will give you the blessing of the goddess. Infinite opportunities will be given, and noble heroes will follow you.” “…” Pria closed\n\n\nher eyes\n\n.\n\n\nIt was spread out, vomiting blood.\n\n\n“Fu, Pria! Pria!”\n\n\nthe blond young man screamed, but Pria did not open her eyes.\n\n\nAnd then.\n\n\nKoo-Goo-Goo Palace.\n\n\nThe entire palace began to shake.\n\n\nOne by one, the pillars fell and were smashed, and part of the ceiling fell down.\n\n\nThe foreshadowing of collapse . The palace is about to collapse.\n\n\n“Challenge. Conquer. Conquer your fate. The golden throne is yours.”\n\n\nThe palace was collapsing in the midst of the goddess\n\n‘ song.\n\n\nDid this happen?\n\n\nIndeed.\n\n\n‘All of them are cowards.’\n\n\nLittle people.\n\n\nPria’s expression is right.\n\n\nYou can’t call them heroes.\n\n\nSome questions are solved.\n\n\nWhy Pria is the main character in most missions.\n\n\nMore bluntly, Taonier revolves around that woman.\n\n\nThis time The heroes who went through the promotion ceremony will know why they fight and will burn their will to do the mission. It was a very exemplary method of boosting morale\n\n. “If\n\n\nthis\n\n\nis true, ” I laughed\n\n, looking\n\nup . ”\n\nHey.\n\n” Bifrost\n\nwas trembling\n\nlike crazy. said that this sword is the crystallization of interfering power with infinite possibilities. It seems to be true\n\n.\n\n\nThere’s no need for such a cheesy play,\n\nbring it in.\n\n‘The real thing.’\n\n\nUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.\n\n\nI grabbed the bifrost that was burning black.\n\n\nI grabbed the hilt of the sword, took a posture, and cut it down.\n\n\nClinking!\n\n\nWhat was blocking my eyes was shattered like glass.",
