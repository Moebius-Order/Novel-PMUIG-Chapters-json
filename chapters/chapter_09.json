The air was chilly.\n\n\nThere was no one in the square.\n\n\n‘Where did you go?’\n\n\nI clicked my tongue. After confirming that Jenna went into the house, she followed her, but it was not there. I was thinking of giving up the sofa.\n\n\nno bed\n\n\nIt’s good.\n\n\nThe training camp is open. If he had moved his head for the past week, now it was time to move his body. I entered the gates of the training center.\n\n\n[Training Center Lv. 1]\n\n\nThe area is 50 pyeong.\n\n\nThere are scarecrows made of straw all over the place. The display stand in the corner contained weapons for practice, such as wooden swords and wooden spear shields. Other than that, it was empty, but it was only a level 1 training center. Even this much, it was a sense.\n\n\nI started running along the walls of the training camp.\n\n\nTake two light breaths in and exhale deeply once.\n\n\nIt was a simple technique learned in the army canter. I ran like that for 10 minutes.\n\n\nRunning at a slow pace, I didn’t feel tight in my calves or out of breath.\n\n\nI opened the status window.\n\n\n[Han Israat ( ) Lv. 5(Exp 44/50)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 15/15]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 15/15]\n\n\n[Stamina: 15/15]\n\n\n[Agility: 15/15]\n\n\n[Skill: None]\n\n\nThat’s miserable.\n\n\nI frowned. The growth rate per level is only 4. Why does intelligence rise again? It’s a useless stat for a physical type.\n\n\nBut even so, it is clear that it is superior to my body on Earth. After being discharged from the military, I didn’t even pay attention to exercise, and I always rode a car, so I was often out of breath when I climbed just a few stairs.\n\n\nI was the specimen of modern people who lack exercise.\n\n\nBut now it felt like I had returned to my days in the army.\n\n\nTo the time when I was desperate to get a special warrior.\n\n\n‘This world has different laws from the Earth.’\n\n\nThe ramen in the display case and the orange juice in the refrigerator are filled the next day no matter how much you eat and drink, and after thinking about what you want, open the drawer or closet and the item will appear. Of course, there is no such thing as K-2 or AK-47.\n\n\nAll I could get was clothes and daily necessities like pencils and toilet paper.\n\n\nAfter running for 30 minutes, my body warmed up to a good condition.\n\n\nI took a deep breath and started doing push-ups.\n\n\nI understand now.\n\n\nThere are a few heroes who are often of the same rank but have different fighting abilities than others.\n\n\none thing they have in common.\n\n\ndon’t neglect training\n\n\nIn the beginning, I didn’t know. Stats and levels don’t go up just because you train, so why don’t you come out of the training center like that. Still, it was admirable that they put effort into the subject, a game character, so they continued to upgrade the facilities.\n\n\nNow that I think about it, I don’t think they were game characters.\n\n\nAnyway, their efforts paid off, and the higher the level, the higher the grade, the more they gradually stood out.\n\n\nI defined this as ‘constitution’.\n\n\nJust as a strong foundation is needed to build a tall building, it is to lay the foundation.\n\n\n1-star heroes start with a base stat of 10.\n\n\nStrength is 10, intelligence is 10, stamina is 10, and agility is 10.\n\n\nWhether you are a hearty lady or a grandfather who works for tomorrow, your physical abilities will be the same. But the results are different.\n\n\n‘First mental.’\n\n\nThe Master doesn’t even pay attention to the heroes who often fall into fear or panic.\n\n\nThe power to remain calm in any situation and look for the possibility of victory.\n\n\nThat’s why the ‘combat logic’ that makes this possible is recognized as an S-class passive.\n\n\n‘Technology second.’\n\n\nThe second condition for distinguishing gemstones is technology.\n\n\nSome heroes are good at swords and some are good at spears. The talent for weapon skills is different for each hero. High-ranking heroes are usually summoned with their talents in bloom, and low-ranking heroes are often hidden and must be found by the master.\n\n\nI don’t know my skills yet. There will be many opportunities to find out. I decided not to fret.\n\n\n‘The third body.’\n\n\nthat’s what i’m doing now\n\n\nWork that gives direction and momentum to growth.\n\n\nmental.\n\n\ntechnology.\n\n\nflesh.\n\n\nWhen these three elements come together, I will have the competitiveness to compete with the 5 stars.\n\n\nI know because I’ve dealt with\n\n\nthem, but they’re real monsters.\n\n\nSince I’m working out like that,\n\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n\nA familiar voice was heard.\n\n\nI stopped doing push-ups and stood up. When I looked at the entrance of the training center, Jenna with her red hair in a pigtail was looking at me.\n\n\nI said.\n\n\n“I train to catch monsters. Why?”\n\n\n“Why are you talking so aggressively? I tried to find it.”\n\n\nJenna entered the training center grumbling. Then he fiddled with the wooden bow in the old barrel.\n\n\n“I’ve been thinking all night. What to do next. You can’t get out of here right?”\n\n\nI didn’t answer.\n\n\nJenna took out her wooden bow and pulled the bowstring.\n\n\n“Cuddle me too. I’ll listen carefully.”\n\n\n“What do you wear?”\n\n\n“I know, but I reply. Well, I’m good at shooting arrows. I won’t bother you. My father was a hunter, so it was my hobby to shoot arrows in my free time.”\n\n\nJenna lifted a wooden arrow from the barrel and fired it quickly. The arrow pierced the scarecrow 10m away with a shallow bang sound.\n\n\n“I don’t think the situation will change even if I cry and drag on. Brother, do you know how to survive?”\n\n\n“Is yesterday your first real fight?”\n\n\n“Of course. I lived only at home.”\n\n\n“How well do you shoot the bow?”\n\n\n“It’s okay.”\n\n\nJenna fired her bow once more.\n\n\nThe same scarecrow. It was a hit.\n\n\n‘Status window.’\n\n\n[Zena Shirai ( ) Lv. 2(Exp 5/20)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 11/11]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 10/10]\n\n\n[Stamina: 11/11]\n\n\n[Agility: 12/12]\n\n\n[Possessed Skill: Lesser Archery (Lv.1)]\n\n\nGrowth is low at 4, but Agility has increased by 2 points instead of Intelligence. In addition, he has a precedent skill for 1-star subjects.\n\n\nOf the three who escaped, he was the only one who returned.\n\n\nIt was my first real fight, so although I was afraid, I didn’t go into panic and shot a goblin to death. He wasn’t obsessed with dead people, and he had a clear goal of what to do next.\n\n\n‘It’s a gemstone.’\n\n\nI remembered yesterday’s battle. I gave them weapons, and the three of them ran away. What if the next ones are the same ass? Can I handle the enemies alone?\n\n\nShouldn’t we live before the competition?\n\n\nI answered.\n\n\n“Okay. I’ll help you.”\n\n\n“Please take care of me, brother.”\n\n\nJenna smiled and held out her hand.\n\n\nI took that hand.\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ is favored by ‘Han( )’.]\n\n\n[Closeness bonus created.]\n\n\n[Tips/Ability bonuses are given when forming a party with heroes who are close to each other. Make good use of this.]\n\n\n“My father said, if you want to live, get on the rope well.”\n\n\n“I see.”\n\n\n“Isn’t he a wonderful father?”\n\n\nI explained the basic rules for picking me up to Jenna.\n\n\nThat there is a Master who gives us orders. That we have to subjugate enemies or carry out missions according to that order. The number of floors increases each time you complete a mission, and when you reach the 100th floor, you can probably be freed.\n\n\n“You mean you have to fight the monsters all the time?”\n\n\n“That’s why I’m training. Because I need to develop strength.”\n\n\nThere are many ways to become stronger besides training, but most of them are currently unopened content with low reach. At this point all I could do was train.\n\n\n“Should the two of us fight alone?”\n\n\nI also explained the summons. The Master summons humans from another world with gems and gold. That we came to this world caught up in that summon.\n\n\nIn the future, people will be constantly summoned and we have to compete with them and sometimes cooperate with them to fulfill our mission.\n\n\nI hid the identity of this world and myself.\n\n\n“That’s all I can explain. Got it?”\n\n\n“Yes, I understand.”\n\n\nJenna nodded. His face wasn’t good, but he didn’t show it openly. It’s calming the stomach.\n\n\nThere was no whining or childishness that a child would see.\n\n\nHe accepts the situation calmly.\n\n\n‘It’ll be useful enough.’\n\n\n“Are we a series of births?”\n\n\n“Serial birth?”\n\n\n“When I die, my brother dies, and when my brother dies, I die too.”\n\n\nThat’s not it.\n\n\nSynthesis was not explained.\n\n\n“Anyway, the master will be back soon, and then the battle begins. Until then, do some training. It’s better than being absorbed.”\n\n\n“yep!”\n\n\nJenna, who saluted with a loud movement, lifted the wooden bow.\n\n\nTraining started again. There was nothing special about training, just physical training or swinging a sword at a scarecrow and shooting arrows.\n\n\nBut neither I nor Jenna were playful.\n\n\nLives depended on it.\n\n\nafter a day of training.\n\n\nThe reason for not finding Jenna at the dorm is also revealed.\n\n\nWhen I opened the door of the dorm, a modern house appeared, and when Jenna opened the door, it was the inside of a small tree house. I called Isel and asked him, and he said:\n\n\n[Are you dissatisfied? I’m just grateful that I didn’t end up in the barn!]\n\n\nNeither I nor Zena argued because I had no complaints about life. The place seemed to change depending on who opened the door.\n\n\nThat’s how I started training and the third day.\n\n\n[Welcome to Pick Me Up!]\n\n\nI stopped the hand that was swinging the wooden sword.\n\n\nThe straw straw scarecrow was in tatters.\n\n\n‘Status window.’\n\n\n[Han Israat ( ) Lv. 5(Exp 44/50)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 15/15]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 15/15]\n\n\n[Stamina: 15/15]\n\n\n[Agility: 15/15]\n\n\n[Possessed Skill: Lesser Swordsmanship (Lv. 1) Lesser Shield Skill (Lv. 1)]\n\n\nThere are two skills obtained. It is a low-level swordsmanship and a low-level shield skill that apply correction to the sword and shield, respectively. Jenna’s low-level archery has risen to level 2.\n\n\nI did as much as I could.\n\n\n“Get ready. The Master is here.”\n\n\n“Already?”\n\n\n“What? It’s been three days already.”\n\n\nWe returned our weapons and went out to the square.\n\n\nEquipment from the training center could not be taken outside.\n\n\n[Loading has finished.]\n\n\n[TOUCH ! (selection)]\n\n\n[Awesome event for new masters!]\n\n\n[Write a review and get a star rating!]\n\n\n[I am the king of capture! To the official cafe…]\n\n\nThe announcement was skipped and the Master entered the main screen.\n\n\nI calculated the time multiplier of the earth and waiting room. If the master accesses this place every day, a day on earth is three days here.\n\n\nThe door to the summons opened.\n\n\n“Summons!”\n\n\n“Yes, it comes.”\n\n\nThe maximum number of people in a party is five.\n\n\nI will draw three times.\n\n\n[Summon a hero!]\n\n\n[Summon a hero with gold or gems. Choose the infinite heroes summoned by Mobius Summon!]\n\n\n[Start summoning the Master. I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of hero will come out!]\n\n\n[Talkak durururu.]\n\n\n[Follow me!]\n\n\n[Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ has learned the hero ‘Aaron’!] [\n\n\nCommon!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ Kenna’ is the hero ‘Toby ( )’!]\n\n\n[Common!]\n\n\n[Master ‘Amkena’ has learned the hero ‘Yelson’s ( )’!] Are they\n\n\nall 1 star?\n\n\nA faint light leaked from inside the summoning station.\n\n\nAfter a while, three men walked out with puzzled faces.\n\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n\n“Misters! Get ready to fight. I’ll teach you when it’s over safely!”\n\n\n“Ready to fight? What are you? Answer me!”\n\n\n[Form a party.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop heroes!]\n\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Toby ( )’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[‘Yel Sons()’ joins ‘Party 1’!]\n\n\n[Open space-time’s opening!]\n\n\nKnocked up.\n\n\nThe front door opened.\n\n\nAt the same time, the door to the armory opened.\n\n\nIt is much faster than the previous car.\n\n\n“Jenna, raise your weapon before it’s too late!”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\nwe ran",
