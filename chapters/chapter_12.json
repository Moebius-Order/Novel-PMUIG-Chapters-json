If you want to live, get on the rope well (4).\n\n\nOpportunities are given.\n\nAs far as I can see, it’s really generous.\n\nEven if the detailed things we experience in battle are omitted and transmitted to the master outside the screen, it does not mean that the master does not know the situation at all. It’s enough to know who fights the most, who plays the most, and who lags behind.\n\n[Add ‘Han( )’ to Favorites.]\n\n[Add ‘Zena( )’ to Favorites.]\n\nHe didn’t seem to have any intention of making the same mistake as the first time.\n\nIsel appeared and cried out.\n\n[Jenna Yelsons. go into synthesis Execution!]\n\n“Synthesis, where is it?”\n\n[See the right door? You can go in there.]\n\nYelsons looked at me anxiously.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nwant help?\n\nIf at least I pretended to fight, I would have tried to help a little. I was willing to give up at least one goblin, just like Shay did to me.\n\nI told Jenna.\n\n“Go away. Nothing will happen to you.”\n\n“I’ll be back.”\n\nJenna left for the synthesis with firm steps. Elsons, on the other hand, couldn’t take a step.\n\n“Why aren’t you going?”\n\n“Go, what will happen if I go?”\n\n“You will be judged for what you have done.”\n\n“I’m the only one who was unreasonably brought here!”\n\n“That’s your idea.”\n\n[It’s the first time we agree!]\n\nA mischievous smile appeared on Issel’s lips.\n\n[I’m tired of putting diapers on my babies. Go in quickly.]\n\n“I’m not going.”\n\n[Really?]\n\nIssel threw the Yelsons into the synthetic lab.\n\nThe door is closed.\n\n[Are you sure you want to synthesize?]\n\n[Yes (selection) / No]\n\n[Synthesis complete!]\n\n[‘Yelson’s ( )’ becomes light and disappears.]\n\n[‘Jenna ( )’ level up! Acquisition of ‘hawk eye’ skill!]\n\nShortly after.\n\nThe synthesizer’s door opened and Jenna walked out with a bewildered expression.\n\n“What happened? The old man turned into light and disappeared.”\n\n“Here, the useless guy dies as a sacrifice to the useful guy. Next is my turn. Which one of you will be.”\n\nI looked at the two and said.\n\nThe door to the synthesis was not yet closed.\n\n[Next one Toby!]\n\n“Me, are you letting me go home?”\n\nIsel grabbed Toby’s wrist and tossed it. I went into the synthetic lab after that. The purple magic circle beneath the synthetic cellar surrounded by metal walls shone ominously.\n\n“Right? I’m going home. I’m going back!”\n\n“I’d rather think of it that way.”\n\nToby murmured with a delighted face.\n\nI didn’t even have the strength to respond. It would be better to go without pain like that than to die from a monster. Toby slowly disintegrated and disappeared, starting with his legs.\n\n[Synthesis complete!]\n\n[‘Toby ( )’ turns into light and disappears.]\n\n[‘Han ( )’ level up! Acquiring the ‘Calmity’ skill!]\n\nAfter coming out to the plaza, the synthesis center was closed and did not open again. Aaron, the last one left, stared blankly at me.\n\nI smiled and patted Aaron’s shoulder.\n\n“You’re lucky.”\n\n“Why, why don’t you come back? Could it be that he’s dead?”\n\n“You could have gone home. Why, do you want to try it too?”\n\nAaron shook his head frantically. Then he said with a reddened face.\n\n“You bastard, you know… didn’t you tell me!”\n\n“Would you have believed me if I told you? I thought they were kids who spoke a foreign language because they didn’t listen to me so much.”\n\nAaron shuddered, but did not run at me. I just went into the dorm with a deep moan.\n\nI said to Issel.\n\n“Is this the end of today’s schedule?”\n\n[No wait! I haven’t disconnected yet.]\n\nIssel did somersaults and disappeared.\n\nAfter a while, a system message popped up.\n\n[Build the facility. Please touch the type of facility you want.]\n\n[You have selected ‘Blacksmith’, an annex of ‘Arsenal Lv.1’. Would you like to build? 500 gems are consumed for construction.]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\nIt’s a forge.\n\nbut. Since the materials had accumulated quite a bit, it was time to synthesize the equipment.\n\n[If Master Reality is busy, how about allowing the hero to act autonomously? You can get a special harvest!]\n\n[Tips/The hero’s ‘autonomous action’ is one of the core features of Pick Me Up, and it is a system in which the hero acts according to his will without a master accessing it. The result of the action depends on the hero’s inclination.]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n[Do you want to close the master connection?]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n[Then goodbye!]\n\nThe rainbow-colored sky turned gray. has changed Amkena ended Pick Me Up.\n\n“Are you done?”\n\n“first.”\n\n“They…”\n\n“Dead, probably.”\n\n“Those who think they don’t need a Master disappear from that room.”\n\n“Why are you so depressed. Whenever you frown and say you don’t want to mess around.”\n\n“If one day I’m no longer needed, will I be too?”\n\nHis expression was calm, but his hands were shaking.\n\n“The higher the floor, the stronger the monsters to fight and the humans summoned. If you die, you die by the enemy or die as a sacrifice, one of the two.”\n\n“I see. My brother knows everything.”\n\nI asked Jenna.\n\n“Do you want to live?”\n\n“yes.”\n\n“Then follow your father’s words.”\n\nMuttering her father’s words, Jenna looked at me.\n\n“If you want to live…”\n\n“Climb well.”\n\nI passed Jenna and returned to the inn.\n\nI took orange juice out of the refrigerator. Lying on the black sofa with my legs stretched out and drinking it, it was wonderfully refreshing.\n\n“Isel, come out if you are there.”\n\n[What are you, oragara!]\n\n“That repertoire is boring. Change it.”\n\n[Quaaah!]\n\nIssel rushed at me.\n\nI stayed still. Issel couldn’t bear to touch my body and only swung his fists in front of me.\n\n“You are suffering too.”\n\n[Noisy!]\n\n“By the way, you send the tips to Amkena, right?”\n\n[That’s why! Does it have anything to do with you?]\n\n“It does.”\n\nI gulped down the juice from the plastic cup. goal.\n\n“Can you access the Internet?”\n\n[Internet?]\n\n“If you can interfere with Pick Me Up’s system, can’t you use the Internet too?”\n\n[What do you do on your own?]\n\n“Why do you keep asking? If you answer, good things will happen.”\n\n[I can do it. Web surfing is my hobby.]\n\n“Then, the tip you’re suggesting is based on the café strategy. After pulling out 10 equipment kits, level 1 at the training center. After that, open the blacksmith’s shop.”\n\nThis is the most popular post on the official Pick Me Up cafe. 20 million views. 5 million referrals. The strategy was published numerous times in other Internet webzines, and was translated and spread all over the world.\n\nThe author’s account name is Loki.\n\nThe strategy text outlines what facilities and how the heroes were selected and raised.\n\n[Do you know Loki?]\n\n“I know. I’m a Pick Me Up user too.”\n\n[Heng, no matter what, it must be a tumble puppy rolling around on the lower floors! I can’t compare myself to Loki. Master of Master, he’s the god of pick me up! If Loki had only had 7 stars, he would have been number one in the world long ago!] \n\nI grinned.\n\n“Why do you like Loki?”\n\n[Because he is the one who makes the impossible possible!]\n\n“Oh, he makes the impossible possible.”\n\n[You’re a Pick Me Up user, but you don’t even know that?]\n\n“That’s me.”\n\n[What?]\n\n“I’m Loki.”\n\n[Now, now, are you kidding me?!]\n\n“Account number 46631913.”\n\nIssel’s eyes popped out.\n\nThis guy also knew my account number.\n\nThe account number of Pick Me Up can only be known by the master himself and the person in charge of the server of Pick Me Up. The master never discloses the account number because it can be hacked if disclosed to others.\n\n[Yes yes no you? Loki-sama…?]\n\n“Don’t you believe it? Can you tell me at least your Goggle account? Go to the Mutube channel.”\n\nI also gave Goggle’s email and password.\n\nIssel hurriedly disappeared and reappeared a moment later.\n\n[…Do it.]\n\n“What?”\n\n[…I want your autograph, you idiot!]\n\nIsel held out a pen and paper with a red face.\n\nI took the paper, drew it out, and returned it. Issel kissed the graffiti I scribbled.\n\n[Oh yea! With this, I am also an excellent member of Ragnaroki!]\n\n“What is Ragnaroki?”\n\n[Master of Master Loki’s Fan Cafe! Loki’s signature is required to become an excellent member!]\n\nWas there such a thing?\n\nIt’s a golden age.\n\nwhat else is ragnaroki The naming sense is the worst.\n\n[Ah ah anyway you! No, you’re Loki-sama…]\n\n“Speak in short language. It’s embarrassing.”\n\n[Is that really Loki? really really? Really?]\n\n“That’s because it’s true.”\n\n[Kyao!]\n\nIsel, who had been running around for a while, suddenly came to his senses and said.\n\n[for a moment. Then did I say such a cheeky thing to Loki?]\n\n“Right now, it’s just one star, so where else is there other than being cheeky?”\n\n[I told Loki to be a pup…!]\n\nIssel started to panic.\n\nI can’t keep track of the emotional changes.\n\n[sorry! If I had known it was Loki, I wouldn’t have done that! Really!]\n\n“It’s crazy, so do it in moderation. I’m not too angry.”\n\n[Why is Loki here… Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh\n\nIssel screamed, holding her head.\n\n[I want to live for fun…]\n\n“…”\n\nWas it that shocking?\n\nI can’t understand. This is almost at the level of a sasaeng fan.\n\nIsel, who was frustrated with her pigtails bobbing, jumped up and said.\n\n[Go go go go go go go go go! What will happen to Niflheim without you?]\n\nNiflheim is the name of the waiting room on my account.\n\nIt consists of a total of 13 floors, and is called the king of infrastructure construction among ranker types, such as accommodations with a capacity of 20,000, a 22-level training center and an 18-level arsenal.\n\nThen what do you do?\n\nI, the real master, is here.\n\nI let out a deep sigh.\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n[You’re not going to fold it?]\n\n“It’s like this, what can I do?”\n\n[Then what will happen to the 20,000 troops of Fallen City!]\n\n“It will work somehow. Niflheim will not disappear without me.”\n\n[However, if there is no master, Loki…]\n\n“If you’re so sorry, send it back.”\n\n[I can’t do that.]\n\nIssel lowered her head with a grim expression.\n\nKnow. This guy is also just a middle manager who gets hit and miss with his boss and work.\n\n“Anyway, the owner of this waiting room is a human on Earth, right?”\n\n[Yeah.]\n\nOkay, I became compliant.\n\nI decided to take this opportunity to ask questions.\n\n“Even the heroes that are summoned are not artificial intelligence.”\n\n[that’s right. The world they belong to is slightly different, but they are all human.]\n\n“Can I return to Earth if I climb the tower to the 100th floor?”\n\n[that… I don’t know.]\n\n“Don’t you know?”\n\n[Really! Trust me!]\n\n“Okay. Next question. Who brought me here?”\n\n[…Can’t answer.]\n\n“Ha, that’s right.”\n\n[Sorry.]\n\n“Then let’s skip this. Like you said, you’ll find out when you climb the tower. To the next question. How far can you access the master’s authority?”\n\n[Right now, it’s just about popping up help, opening and closing facilities, and assisting autonomous actions.]\n\nNext.\n\nThis is the crux of the question.\n\n“Is the waiting room of the other masters the same as this one?”\n\n[The details are slightly different, but the basics are the same.]\n\n“…”\n\nDo 100 million worlds like this exist?\n\nLaughter came out at the absurd scale.\n\nI never thought that what happened in the game would be real in another world. That a decision I made carelessly could have been a death sentence for the hero in the game.\n\nIf he returned to Earth, he decided to climb the tower in a way that would save the heroes as much as possible. Except for those who can’t do their part.\n\nCombat isn’t the only way a hero can contribute to the Master. Most of the functions of this waiting room are locked, so it is useless if you are not talented in combat.\n\nIf the rank of this waiting room was a bit higher, even those who died in vain could have a role. They’re just out of luck.\n\nBut what can I do? that the world is like that.\n\n‘I wonder if the Niflheim kids are doing well without me.’\n\nIf the heroes there were still alive, they would have noticed my absence by now.\n\nI couldn’t go back for a while.\n\nIt will be fine though.\n\nPick Me Up has a function where a designated hero operates the waiting room in place of the master when the master is absent for a long time. Therefore, Pick Me Up also had the title of an idle game.\n\n‘Siris will take care of it.’\n\nNiflheim’s Submaster Siris was exceptionally smart and wise.\n\nWhen I entrusted one, he did two, and he had the gift of knowing what I wanted like a ghost. I really can’t believe this is artificial intelligence.\n\nAnyway, my nose is three.\n\nI decided to find a way to live.\n\n“Isel.”\n\n[Ugh huh?]\n\n“Do you want to climb the tower?”\n\nIsel hesitated and nodded.\n\n“Listen to me. I’ll let you go up.”\n\nThis time, he nodded absently.\n\ncurrent status.\n\nThe number of floors reached is 3 floors.\n\nAutonomy was unlocked and the forge was opened.\n\nThe scope of activity has been greatly expanded.\n\nI’ll have to slow down a bit from tomorrow.\n\nWith Issel’s help, it would be possible.\n\nI leaned back on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.\n\nThe gray sky remained.",
