Free 10 Draw (3)\n\n\n[Han Jenna Dazil Greet Gale came out!]\n\n\n“Why don’t the people who went earlier come…?”\n\n\nDajil blurred his horse’s tail.\n\n\nSaid Gail, who was lying there groaning.\n\n\n“Look, fairy man. I have arthritis and can’t walk anymore. Take me out.”\n\n\n“Arthritis? You’ve been walking well.”\n\n\n“What should I do when I suddenly get sick!”\n\n\n[These are…]\n\n\nI shrugged and entered the door in front of the plaza. Inside the door was a large circular room, with huge mirrors that could exceed 10m standing side by side. The information of the dungeon appeared on the mirror.\n\n\n[Climb the tower and save the world!]\n\n\n[Main dungeon: Current number of floors to climb – 0]\n\n\n[Dungeon feast that changes every day!]\n\n\n[Day dungeon]\n\n\n[Cannot access! Clear the 5th floor of the main dungeon.]\n\n\n[Collect rare materials!]\n\n\n[Exploration dungeon]\n\n\n[Cannot access! Clear the 10th floor of the main dungeon.]\n\n\nExcept for the left side, the other two mirrors are blurred.\n\n\n‘It’s like this.’\n\n\nLooking down as a master and looking up from the perspective of a hero.\n\n\nThat feeling is the difference between heaven and earth.\n\n\nare you okay. can do. You cannot die without knowing why in a place like this.\n\n\nOnly that one thought chilled his reason.\n\n\nAfter a while, other party members entered the space-time gap.\n\n\n“I have arthritis!”\n\n\n“He told me to come. Even if I die, I’ll die with you, and even if I live, I’ll have to live with you!”\n\n\n[Noisy, noisy, noisy! Quiet and prepare.]\n\n\n“What, what are you preparing for?”\n\n\n“I’ve never held a spear before…”\n\n\n[The main dungeon’s current challenging floor is 1.]\n\n\n[The door opens in 10 seconds. Get ready!]\n\n\nI looked at the party members behind me. Jenna and Gail were constantly bickering and Darjil was sweating profusely. And Grit trembled in the corner.\n\n\n‘Is there anyone who can help?’\n\n\nOnly sigh came out.\n\n\nThe mirror on the left began to glow.\n\n\nThe light grew stronger and blinded me and covered the entire room.\n\n\n“What is this light!”\n\n\n“Don’t freak out! It’s starting!”\n\n\nI shouted. It was something I said to the party members and also to myself. The only person I can trust in this world is me. If I don’t come to my senses, that’s it.\n\n\nI muttered several times as if brainwashing myself.\n\n\nAnd when the light went out, I was in a strange place.\n\n\n[Floor 1.]\n\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n\n[Goal – Exterminate the enemy!]\n\n\nA calm wind blows.\n\n\nAn endless plain extending beyond the horizon.\n\n\n‘Field type meadow.’\n\n\nBoth the mission type and the field type are okay.\n\n\nIncidentally, the stages of Pick Me Up are random. It was not decided what kind of mission would come out and which field would come out.\n\n\n“What, what? Where is this place?”\n\n\n“Where is it, it’s a battlefield!”\n\n\nI hit the shield with an old iron sword.\n\n\nFour goblins were grouping 10 meters away. He wears a helmet and holds a curved sword. There was also one with a sling catapult.\n\n\n[Goblin Lv.3] X 4\n\n\n2 levels higher than in the tutorial.\n\n\nThe goblin’s eyes that spotted us glowed red.\n\n\n“Did I tell you earlier? If we don’t fight, we’ll die. So, wake up…”\n\n\nI said and looked back.\n\n\nThere was no one.\n\n\n“This shit.”\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ feels fear. All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Dazil( )’ feels fear. All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Grit( )’ feels fear. All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\n[‘Gail ( )’ feels fear. All stats are reduced by 30%.]\n\n\nThe four of them were happily running away from behind.\n\n\nGail, who was said to be suffering from arthritis, was the fastest.\n\n\nI expected it, but I didn’t expect it to be this useless.\n\n\nGale, who hit the edge of the field, rolled over. The next three suffered the same fate.\n\n\n“Agogogo! Waist!”\n\n\n“Why aren’t you leaving?”\n\n\n“Open this door! Let me out! I’m going to shit!”\n\n\n[‘Dazil( )’ panics. All stats decrease by 50%.]\n\n\n[‘Grit( )’ panics. All stats are reduced by 50%.]\n\n\n[‘Gale ( )’ falls into despair. All stats are reduced by 80%.] He\n\n\nstruggles in the corner with no intention of fighting the goblins.\n\n\nDajil hit the wall with the ax he was holding, then grabbed his wrist and fell. Greet hit the wall with his long spear and Gail sprained her back and couldn’t get up.\n\n\nOnly Jenna trudged back.\n\n\n“Brother. Can we get out if we defeat those goblins?”\n\n\nHer amber eyes shook, and cold sweat broke out on her forehead.\n\n\nBut Jenna was holding on tight to the bow.\n\n\n“Do you know how to shoot a bow?”\n\n\n“My father was a hunter.”\n\n\n“I go out and fight, you shoot. Can you?”\n\n\n“yes!”\n\n\n[‘Dazil ( )’ falls into despair. All stats are reduced by 80%.]\n\n\n[‘Grit( )’ falls into despair. All stats are reduced by 80%.]\n\n\n“Those people…”\n\n\n“Never mind. They’re useless. Go!”\n\n\nI gave strength to my left hand holding the shield and ran out.\n\n\nI’ve never used a shield before. The same goes for swords. But I had to write.\n\n\nThe goblins ran amok and charged.\n\n\nStones flying between them!\n\n\nI raised the shield to my face. A heavy shock echoed from his left hand. If it wasn’t for the shield, he would have been hit. A goblin swung a sword in the field of view under the shield.\n\n\nLower the shield in your left hand to block it, and\n\n\nstab it with the sword in your right hand!\n\n\nThe goblin with a deep cut on its arm backed away.\n\n\nI took a few steps back and looked at the situation.\n\n\n‘Why is there only one?’\n\n\nThe reason soon became clear. Excluding the goblin holding the catapult, the other two were running toward the clamoring party members. The three of them couldn’t come to their senses even though the goblins were coming.\n\n\n“Misters, fight! The monster is coming!”\n\n\nAfter quickly loading, Jenna fired her bow.\n\n\nThe arrow grazed over the goblin’s head.\n\n\n“Oops, missed!”\n\n\nWith a bewildered face, Jenna took an arrow from her quiver.\n\n\n‘Never mind those things!’\n\n\ndecided to turn it off.\n\n\nRather fortunately. If they serve as bait, I can defeat the monsters individually. I jumped at the purring goblin with my arms clenched. On the way, he hit the flying stones with his shield. Block the sword with an iron sword and hit the face with a shield!\n\n\n“Kieek!”\n\n\nThe goblin fell flat.\n\n\nyou can like it enough can do! I thrust my sword into the fallen goblin’s chest.\n\n\n“Curr, gurr…”\n\n\nThe goblin dropped his head, frothing from his mouth.\n\n\n“Kiaaa, kiaa!”\n\n\n“Aaaaaaaaaaagh!”\n\n\n[‘Dazil( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nDon’t look back.\n\n\nThere is still one left. A ranged goblin spinning a catapult. I put up my shield and ran. The goblin threw stones. The stone was blocked by a shield.\n\n\nAfter all, choosing a shield was the correct answer.\n\n\n[‘Grit( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\nAlong with a desperate scream, the sound of cloth came from behind. It’s an unpleasant sound like tearing and slicing a piece of meat.\n\n\n“Where are you running away!”\n\n\n“Kirararak!”\n\n\nI attacked the fleeing goblin from behind as if I was tackling it. The goblin tried to hit my forehead with a stone. block with a shield\n\n\n“Long live the shield, you bastard!”\n\n\nThe sword was stabbed into the side where the outline of the ribs were exposed. The unpleasant feeling of scratching bones was transmitted. Ignored it and hit it deep. Pull it out once and put it back in.\n\n\nWhoop, whoop, whoop!\n\n\nAfter putting it in and taking it out four times, the goblin collapsed as if it was about to collapse when I let go of my hand.\n\n\n[‘Gale( )’ has returned to the arms of the goddess. His fighting spirit will be remembered forever.]\n\n\n“Oh, brother…”\n\n\n“What about the remaining two?”\n\n\n“I took care of one!”\n\n\nOn one side of the meadow lay a goblin with an arrow stuck in the back of its head.\n\n\n“But other people…”\n\n\n“Think about that later, come this way!”\n\n\nThe frenzied goblin ran towards Xena. Jenna ran towards me with a shrieking scream. I ran forward with my shield and collided head-on with the goblin.\n\n\n“Big!”\n\n\nIn an instant, my eyes turned red.\n\n\nBlood gushed from the deep cut on his right arm. I lost the iron sword in my right hand.\n\n\n[‘Han( )’ is bleeding. HP decreases at regular intervals.]\n\n\nI hit the goblin with my shield.\n\n\n“Quek!”\n\n\n“You damn bastard!”\n\n\nI took a picture of the fallen goblin’s face with the edge of the shield. Broken teeth and blood spatter. take one more shot Once more. Once more. Once more!\n\n\nThe goblin, who had been shaking its limbs, drooped.\n\n\n“Brother, your arm…”\n\n\n“It’ll be better if you go back.”\n\n\nAlready checked in the tutorial.\n\n\nStill, it hurts so badly. On his right arm, blood gushed like a spring through a long, torn wound. I was a little dizzy because I had anemia.\n\n\n[Clear the stage!]\n\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ level up!]\n\n\n[Reward – 2000G Iron Ore (C) X 2 Copper (C) X 1 Leather (C) X 1]\n\n\n[MVP – ‘Han ( )’]\n\n\nLight is the whole body wrap\n\n\nI closed my eyes and opened them. We returned to the space-time gap in the circular room lined with mirrors.\n\n\n[Did 3 people die? This is why 1-stars are like this.]\n\n\nIsel looked at Jenna with disapproval.\n\n\nI checked my right arm. The wounds are nowhere to be found. The pain remained sharp, but even this gradually disappeared.\n\n\nYes too. Even on the verge of death, if you return to the waiting room, everything will be restored. It was like that in game too. There was a time when ‘zombie parties’ were popular, taking advantage of the fact that people can recover as long as their lives are attached.\n\n\n[Go back to the square. I’m going to close the door.]\n\n\nIssel pointed to the open door. I trudged out. Jenna followed me anxiously.\n\n\nThe door is closed.\n\n\n[Congratulations on breaking through the 1st floor!]\n\n\n[Going up to the 2nd floor.]\n\n\nTrembling. Kurur.\n\n\nA strange sound was heard, and the square floor shook.\n\n\n“Why are you like this?!”\n\n\n“It’s going up.”\n\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n\n“Second floor.”\n\n\nVibration stopped.\n\n\nSo what’s going on now\n\n\nBreak through the 2nd floor? There is no choice. The battle also saw Amkena. You would have known that there was no answer at this rate.\n\n\n[Do you want to enhance your master power?]\n\n\n[Tips/Heroes from advanced summons are stronger than normal heroes.] [\n\n\nTips/You can develop heroes by building facilities such as training centers.]\n\n\nHere, there are two options for non-paying users . there is\n\n\nDoing paid gacha or constructing facilities. In the early days of the game, there was a conflict between the ‘Hero Draw’ faction, which was used to draw gems, and the ‘Infrastructure Construction’ faction, which was used for facility construction, but the conflict ended after I directly compared and proved the efficiency.\n\n\n[Build the facility. Please touch the type of facility you want.]\n\n\n[You have selected ‘Training Center’. Would you like to build? 500 gems are consumed for construction.]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nThat’s right.\n\n\nIt wasn’t like I didn’t see the strategy at all. The door to the training camp, which had been locked, was opened.\n\n\n[The training center has been completed. Heroes will now train themselves. Be aware that strengthening the Training Center with Gems and Gold Blueprints will give you a wider and more powerful effect.]\n\n\n[Tips/Continuous battles tire the hero. You need to take proper rest so that you can exert your maximum fighting power.]\n\n\nThe net exhaustive tips continue.\n\n\n[Are you sure you want to terminate the connection to the master?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Then, goodbye!]\n\n\nIs this the end here?\n\n\nLooking at today’s play, Amkena is a facility-oriented, no-charge light user. It was the type I most wanted. You don’t have to compete with expensive heroes who have painted stars, and you have a solid foundation to grow.\n\n\nMost non-paying users reach their limits from the upper floors of the tower, but that will come later.\n\n\n[Whoah! It’s so hard I’m going to die.]\n\n\nIsel, who appeared before I knew it, stretched out his hand.\n\n\nJenna asked in a half-trembling voice.\n\n\n“How are we now?”\n\n\n[How come. You just have to rest until the master connects. Since the training center is open, train there. The accommodation is over there. Spread out and sleep on your own.]\n\n\n“Are the rest of the people… all dead?”\n\n\n[idiot. Can’t you see it?]\n\n\nJenna’s complexion turned pale.\n\n\n“Why did you call us? What’s the purpose!”\n\n\n[You are annoying like him. Climb the tower if you want to know.]\n\n\n“Is that the tower you climbed earlier?”\n\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\n“Answer me, brother!”\n\n\n“You already answered. Going up.”\n\n\nAs much as the main dungeon was cleared, the waiting room seemed to go up as well. I couldn’t imagine what kind of bizarre structure it was, so I decided not to care. You just have to accept it that way.\n\n\nJenna clenched her fists and shouted.\n\n\n“I’m going back!”\n\n\n“The lodging is over there.”\n\n\nI pointed to the room leading to the house. Jenna huffed and went, slamming the door and entering.\n\n\n“I’m also curious.”\n\n\n[What’s the question on the topic that I barely cleared the first floor?]\n\n\n“Is the time here and the Earth different?”\n\n\n[Don’t ask questions! Don’t answer me!]\n\n\n“I guess so.”\n\n\nAssuming that, things fit.\n\n\nTime here in the waiting room passes faster than on Earth. I don’t know what speed it is. You’ll have to figure that out later. And at its core is the fairy Isel.\n\n\n“I just liked the tip. Please do the same next time.”\n\n\n[This profit! A 1-star trash!]\n\n\nIssel stomped and disappeared as if running away.\n\n\n‘As expected.’\n\n\nMaybe the fairies can’t touch me.\n\n\nIt is presumed that the case where it can be touched is when self-defence is established like Mormont or when the master’s order is rejected.\n\n\nLet’s get to know the rules one by one.\n\n\nAs I walked back to my inn, I noticed my hands shaking.\n\n\n“…”\n\n\n9 people died. A whopping 9 out of 11 people.\n\n\nIf I was wrong, I could have joined the ranks.\n\n\n‘calm down.’\n\n\nIf you don’t adapt, you will be weeded out.\n\n\nThat is the only law in this world.\n\n\nI was able to return to the hostel after almost an hour.\n\n\ncurrent situation.\n\n\n11 summoned, 9 killed, 2 survived.",
