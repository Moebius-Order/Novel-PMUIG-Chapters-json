It’s synthetic!]\n\n\nWhere does this bastard sell drugs?\n\n\nIsel’s dainty eyes furrowed. Every time the wings behind his back fluttered, shining powder fluttered.\n\n\nIsel, who had been thinking about it for a while, clapped his hands as if he remembered.\n\n\n[If you synthesize, you can return to the original world! Let’s see, Han Israt where you live…]\n\n\nA ledger appeared on the right side of Isel. Isel fumbled through the ledger and stopped at one place.\n\n\n[In Taoni where you live!]\n\n\n“Taoni?”\n\n\n[Heim Peninsula in Taone! Your hometown!]\n\n\nUnidentified place names appear quickly.\n\n\nI replied, half astonished.\n\n\n“My hometown is Gangseo-gu, Seoul.”\n\n\n[seoul? Gangseo-gu? Such a place…]\n\n\nIsel’s expression hardened as he looked at the ledger and me alternately.\n\n\n[what what? Who are you? Why is it different from the picture? Han Israt doesn’t look like this?]\n\n\n“Who is Han Israt and where is Taoni? I am Han Seo-jin. I was born in Gangseo-gu, Seoul. I don’t know who you are, but if you say something nice, send it back, huh?”\n\n\n[Could you be from Earth?]\n\n\n“You’re from Earth, so you’re from Mars!”\n\n\nCold sweat broke out on Isel’s forehead.\n\n\nIssel began to rummage through the ledger. I couldn’t even see the movement of my hands, and my eyes rolled quickly up and down.\n\n\n[How does a higher dimension exist…]\n\n\nIsel muttered in an embarrassed voice and pointed at the window at the top of her field of view.\n\n\n[Can you see this too?]\n\n\n[Now Loading…]\n\n\n“I can see it.”\n\n\n[Ahhhhh! How did you handle the job! Crazy, I’m crazy!]\n\n\nIssel shook his head on the spot as if head-banging. Her black hair, braided from side to side, spun like a windmill.\n\n\n[Anyway, go in now! Go in!]\n\n\n“No! Why me! You go in…”\n\n\n[Go in!]\n\n\nIssel grabbed my wrist and threw it away.\n\n\nI felt like I was floating, and then I flew into the synthetase.\n\n\nIron pudduck.\n\n\nThe synthesizer’s door slammed shut.\n\n\nI got up right away and knocked on the door. There were kicks and power throws. But the locked door did not budge.\n\n\n“You, man, take it out! You son of a bitch! I won’t let you go!”\n\n\nHow strong is the power of a child!\n\n\nI couldn’t even resist.\n\n\n“Be quiet, you’re noisy.”\n\n\nShay, the female knight who was leaning against the wall, said. On the floor you stand on, a complicated and bizarre magic circle covering the entire room is engraved.\n\n\nI thought about it and asked.\n\n\n“You, you… where are you from?”\n\n\n“Me? Arantiada.”\n\n\n“Arantia? Where are you from? America? Canada?”\n\n\n“American? Canadian? What are you talking about?\n\n\n‘What kind of bullshit is that?’\n\n\nEven if you bring a foreigner, the language will communicate better than this.\n\n\nDid you say you were a foreigner?\n\n\nI touched my lips. Words that just came out of me. It wasn’t Korean. Neither English nor Japanese.\n\n\nIt was an unknown language.\n\n\nIs there such a thing as nonsense?\n\n\nWith a half-empty heart, I brought up the crucial question. This time, my mouth spat out an unknown language. The words I wanted to get out of my brain seemed to be filtered out.\n\n\n“Are you from Taoni by any chance?”\n\n\n“Yes.”\n\n\n“Not Earth?”\n\n\n“I don’t know of a place like that.”\n\n\nIn other words, did the female knight come from a place called ‘Arantia’ in ‘Taoni’?\n\n\nIt became dark before my eyes. There was no dog dream like this.\n\n\nAbove all, the finale of the nightmare awaits.\n\n\n[Start master synthesis.]\n\n\n[Drag and drop the hero to be sacrificed to the hero you want to synthesize! You can get experience points. The sacrificed hero will disappear.]\n\n\n[Tips/Registering the hero as a favorite can prevent synthesis mistakes.]\n\n\nWhat? You can go back to the original world?\n\n\nWhen I said that I would not go to the synthesis center, I remembered the fairy who had been groaning for a long time. It was Bona Mana Gura.\n\n\nThe last step to decorate the end of the Pick Me Up tutorial.\n\n\nHero synthesis by name. Users will realize the enormous power-up for sacrificing a hero here. because i did too\n\n\nThe problem is that I am a 1 star and that person living here is a 4 star.\n\n\n“Status!”\n\n\n“What are you talking about?”\n\n\n“Status window!”\n\n\nWords that were half-desperate.\n\n\nA small window popped up in front of me.\n\n\n[Han Israat ( ) Lv. 2(Exp 7/20)]\n\n\n[Class: Novice]\n\n\n[Strength: 11/11]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 11/11]\n\n\n[Stamina: 11/11]\n\n\n[Agility: 11/11]\n\n\n[Skill: None]\n\n\nThe fairy called me ‘Han Israt’.\n\n\nIf so, the current stats would be my current situation.\n\n\nI faced Shay, who was looking at me strangely. This time, he whispered ‘status window’ inaudibly.\n\n\n[Shay Radasteri (★★★★) Lv. 2(Exp 3/20)]\n\n\n[Class: Knight]\n\n\n[Strength: 19/19]\n\n\n[Intelligence: 10/10]\n\n\n[Stamina: 18/18]\n\n\n[Agility: 22/22]\n\n\n[Possessed Skill: Combat Logic (Lv.1) Intermediate Sharpening (Lv.1) Knight’s Attitude (Lv.1)]\n\n\nIt’s the same level 2, but the difference in stats is heaven and earth. In addition, Shay also has three prior skills.\n\n\nAmong them, the standout is the combat logic. It was a special passive that was rated as S rank among hundreds of skills. Swordsmanship is a skill that gives an attack power bonus to swordsman-type weapons, and Knight’s Attitude is a state-of-the-art auxiliary skill that eliminates mental illusions.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I don’t have\n\n\n“…Shay.”\n\n\nI said in a trembling voice.\n\n\n“Why but?”\n\n\n“Is this a dream?”\n\n\n“It’s a dream, but it must be an unbreakable dream.”\n\n\nShay laughed.\n\n\n[Do you really want to synthesize it?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\nA strong light rose from the magic circle carved on the floor of the summoning place. As if submerged in water, a subtle sense of floating engulfed the whole body.\n\n\n‘Is it going to end like this?’\n\n\nIf this really is a world of pick me up, and if the ‘master’ controls this game, then I will disappear here as Shay’s sacrifice. for a few pennies of experience.\n\n\nI don’t know if I was active in the battle earlier. But just looking at the number of goblins killed, Shay was four and only one.\n\n\n‘Someone synthesizes 4 stars into 1 star.’\n\n\nThe light grew stronger and I closed my eyes.\n\n\nI hope you will be in the living room of your house when you open your eyes.\n\n\n[Synthesis complete!]\n\n\n[‘Shay (★★★★)’ turns into light and disappears.]\n\n\n“Huh?”\n\n\nI slowly opened my eyes.\n\n\nShay’s body on the other side of the magic circle was engulfed in light and disappeared.\n\n\nShay laughed bitterly.\n\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n\n“Why are you disappearing?”\n\n\n“I wasn’t chosen. That’s all.”\n\n\n“No, crazy, does this make sense? You’re a 4-star and I’m a 1-star!”\n\n\n“Please, Han.”\n\n\nShay turned into particles of light and scattered.\n\n\nrattle.\n\n\nThe door to the plaza opened.\n\n\n[In this way, heroes become stronger through synthesis.]\n\n\n[Believe in the bond with the master hero. The future of the world is in the hands of the Master!]\n\n\n[Tutorial has ended.]\n\n\n[Isel’s tips continue. Don’t miss the essential information to become a strong master!]\n\n\n[You can check more details on the official cafe.]\n\n\n[Rewards will be given. Please check your mailbox.]\n\n\n[Welcome to the world of Pick Me Up!]\n\n\n[Bababam!]\n\n\nAfter a loud sound effect, the hologram window disappeared.\n\n\nStanding in the square for a while, I shouted out loud.\n\n\n“Isel, are you there? Answer me!”\n\n\n[Why are you calling me so annoying!]\n\n\nIssel appeared in an empty space.\n\n\nIssel folded his wings and landed on the floor, waving his arms up and down in a frenzy.\n\n\n[This crazy head! Synthesis of 4 stars from 1 star? Aren’t you brainless? Write your favourites! I told you as a tip tip tip! read tips! Oh oh oh, I’m going crazy, I’m going crazy!]\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nIs that how it happened?\n\n\nThe reason I survived was simple. The way to synthesize heroes is drag and drop. It is a form of touching and pulling the hero to be sacrificed.\n\n\n‘There was a beep.’\n\n\nI didn’t even know that I had dragged it wrong, so I clicked Accept Composite.\n\n\nLaughter leaked out. The only thing I survived was the fact that I was lucky. Shay, on the other hand, died from a simple control miss.\n\n\n[Are you sure you want to terminate the connection to the master?]\n\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\n\n[Then, goodbye!]\n\n\nA message indicating the end of the game appeared.\n\n\nIsel, who struggled for a while, wiped the tears from her eyes.\n\n\n[Damn it. I thought it was just starting…]\n\n\n“Tell me about the situation. I’m going to turn around because I’m curious. Where is this place, how did I get here, and how to get back?”\n\n\n[Hey, why am I!]\n\n\nIsel kicked off the ground and flew away, sticking out her tongue.\n\n\nThe body slowly faded.\n\n\n[If you want to know, go up the tower. Because the answer is there. Bye then!]\n\n\n“Hey, you, wait!”\n\n\nI waved my hand at the place where Isel was, but nothing was caught.\n\n\nran away\n\n\n“…”\n\n\nI was left alone in the plaza.\n\n\nBoth the cheeky fairy and the calm female knight disappeared.\n\n\nThey both seemed to know something I didn’t know. If I knew it would be like this, I would have asked Shay.\n\n\nLeaving the empty plaza behind, I returned to my room.\n\n\nThe room still had the look of a luxury home. When I opened the cupboard above the sink, there was ramen.\n\n\nDepressed, I took out the pot and boiled the water.\n\n\nElectricity, water and gas run through it. I looked for an exit while the water was boiling, but couldn’t find one. It is a building that is unknown how it was formed in the first place.\n\n\nI slurped my noodles.\n\n\nThe ramen I ate after a long time was devastatingly delicious.\n\n\nI fell into bed without even tidying up.\n\n\nOnly then did I realize what had just happened.\n\n\nKerr.\n\n\nThe cry of a goblin like boiling phlegm. Bloodlined ugly eyes. Burning houses and people running away. The sound that a knife swung at me cuts through the air. The life-killing touch that penetrates your fingertips.\n\n\nI wasn’t chosen That’s all.\n\n\nShay’s bitter voice played on repeat.\n\n\nyou are not chosen It was just bad luck. I was the human being who should have been destroyed as it was. Shay, who had disappeared surrounded by light, came to mind.\n\n\n‘Nonsense.’\n\n\nentered the world of the game.\n\n\nCould something like this happen?\n\n\nIf everything is a dream when you wake up, they will laugh at you.\n\n\nHe was also willing to pay tribute to me for dreaming of entering the world of a game.\n\n\nHow could I have such a realistic dream?\n\n\nBut if it’s not a dream.\n\n\nIf everything is the same when you wake up.\n\n\nIf only this inorganic room and the bleak plaza outside were still the same.\n\n\nIf I had entered the game world as a hero, not a master.\n\n\nPulling over the blanket, I remembered.\n\n\nWhat kind of existence am I in Pick Me Up?\n\n\n5th out of 100 million masters worldwide.\n\n\nNo one knows more about this game than I do.\n\n\nI know almost all skill and item crafting methods, efficient strategies and tactics, how to raise heroes, and hidden elements.\n\n\nPeople call me Master of Master.\n\n\nthat’s me\n\n\nIf everything is the same when you open your eyes.\n\n\n‘If that’s the case.’\n\n\nI remembered right before I came over to this world.\n\n\nAn unidentified level 999 bug monster.\n\n\nHe was obviously laughing at me.\n\n\nIt’s him. It must have been him who brought me here.\n\n\n‘You touched the wrong person.’\n\n\nI sharpened my teeth.",
