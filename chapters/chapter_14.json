"full_text": "14. Building internal stability (2)\n\nI am different from ordinary heroes.\n\nI was aware of that. The system log that appears while the master controls the game was only visible to me.\n\nThere is one more thing here.\n\nOpen the stat window right away. Even if you can get past the logs, the story will change from here.\n\nIt means that I can interfere with the system with my will.\n\neven a little bit\n\nI remembered the conversation I had with Isel the night before.\n\nIssel said that the stat window I open is not displayed on the master’s screen.\n\nAn existence half-mixed with a master and a hero.\n\nthat was me\n\n‘then.’\n\nIt will be possible.\n\nInvading the area only permitted by the Master.\n\nI picked up the wooden shield and bow in the armory.\n\n“You wait here.”\n\nI was handed a cart with ingredients from Jenna.\n\n[Blacksmithing Lv. 1]\n\nI opened the small iron door to the left of the armory. The hot heat came rushing in. Inside the smithy, there is a small brazier with a blazing fire and various work tools for crafting an anvil.\n\n[You’re finally making it!]\n\nIssel appeared and circled over my head. Maybe it was the fire in the hearth, but her cheeks were flushed.\n\n“Let’s try it somewhere.”\n\n[So Loki! what do you make Levatein? Or Brunach? Stormblinger? Pragarach?]\n\n“From here?”\n\nThere are no materials and the facility level is low. There are no assistants to help with production. Conversely, if the conditions are sufficient, it is possible to create a ‘super-special weapon’ like Issel said, but it was not the timing to come out yet.\n\n“Open the equipment production window.”\n\n[Yeah!]\n\nA hologram window popped up in one corner of my field of vision. It was the same screen that came up when I clicked the equipment synthesis tab in Pick Me Up.\n\n[Start equipment production!]\n\nPress the production button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAs the screen changed, a window asking for detailed conditions was displayed.\n\n‘It works.’\n\nKind General.\n\nshape sword.\n\nmethod casting.\n\n[You have selected a casting. Are you okay? A penalty will be granted.]\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThere are three ways to craft equipment. Reinforcement to reinforce existing weapons, casting to create new weapons from materials, and consignment to entrust the entire process to craftsmen.\n\n[Insert the ingredients.]\n\nI put 2 iron ores, 1 leather, and 1 plank into the furnace. The fire in the furnace burned fiercely.\n\n“Is it right to put ingredients like this?”\n\n[that’s right. Just do it.]\n\nI touched ‘Start’ at the bottom of the equipment crafting window.\n\n[Insufficient facilities. A penalty will be applied.]\n\n[There is no artisan. A penalty will be imposed.]\n\n[There is no blueprint. A penalty will be granted.]\n\n[Probability of success: Atrocities – unless you are lucky, you will fail! Challenge yourself with better conditions. Are you really okay?]\n\n[Do you want to synthesize?]\n\n[Yes (optional) / No]\n\nI brushed my hands.\n\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve made it, but the senses still remain at my fingertips. A triple penalty with a low facility level, no artisans, and no blueprints. But this is no big deal to me.\n\n[Manufacturing, of course…?]\n\n“Manually.”\n\n[Cheer up!]\n\nWhat do you like?\n\nA hologram screen appeared in the center of my vision. The screen consists of thousands of lines, like a checkerboard. In the middle of the screen, I saw the long sword I wanted to make. The image of the long sword is implemented as dots.\n\n[Teeling!]\n\n[Insufficient facilities!]\n\nA part of the horizontal axis rotated, and the sword distorted.\n\n[Tring!]\n\n[There is no craftsman!]\n\nA part of the vertical axis rotated and the shape of the sword was crushed.\n\n[Tee-ring!]\n\n[There is no blueprint!]\n\nThe fine black disappeared and the screen was covered with white and black dots.\n\nSimilar to a toy cube. Rotate the screen horizontally or vertically to solve the puzzle. The only difference is that the object of the puzzle is a polyhedron. It was a kind of mini game. Of course, most masters don’t play such troublesome games. It’s okay to do it automatically if the conditions are met.\n\n[Choose a puzzle difficulty level. The higher the reward, the higher the reward!]\n\n“To Super Hell.”\n\n[Super hell? It’s a triple penalty?]\n\n“Just do it.”\n\n[You have selected Super Hell difficulty. Do you want to blow stuff up like that? I will not dry it!]\n\n15X15.\n\n15 horizontal lines.\n\n15 vertical lines.\n\nIn the case of Super Hell, the time limit is 3 minutes.\n\nThe image on the screen shook, then rotated once more.\n\nI couldn’t make out any form now.\n\n[Puzzle Start!]\n\nWhy did they make such a useless function?\n\nI don’t even do it except for a few people who have a genuine lung.\n\n‘Does this puzzle have any other meaning?’\n\nIt’s not an ordinary game, so there might be something.\n\nBut now I didn’t know.\n\nTime taken 27 seconds.\n\n[ ! Super Success! ]\n\n[‘Han( )’ produced a ‘well-forged longsword (C-)’!] A\n\nsword protruded from the bottom of the furnace.\n\n[Well-forged iron sword]\n\n[Grade: C-]\n\n[Masterpiece!]\n\n[Sturdy, light and sharp. The basic materials are crude, but they are supplemented with incredible technology.]\n\nBarely C-.\n\nAs the material is the material, it cannot be helped.\n\nThis time he threw a crude bow into the furnace.\n\nI thought while putting in the materials needed for reinforcement.\n\nBows can be divided into two types.\n\nA shortbow that values portability and fire rate.\n\nA longbow that values range and penetrating power.\n\n‘It’s not time to need a longbow yet.’\n\nThe longbow will be needed from the floor where large monsters appear.\n\nAs for the type, the general form chose the shortbow method to strengthen. The weapon to be strengthened is an E-grade crude bow. A mini game has begun.\n\n[ ! Super Success! ]\n\n[‘Han( )’ produced a ‘Balanced Shortbow (C)’!]\n\nI decided to make a spear as well.\n\n[ ! Super Success! ]\n\n[‘Han( )’ produced a ‘Sharp Long Spear (C-)’!]\n\nLastly, the shield was strengthened.\n\n[ ! Super Success! ]\n\n[‘Han( )’ produced a ‘hard iron shield (C)’!]\n\n[This is the hand of God! Legendary Thousand Hands! Kyaaaaa!]\n\nI pushed Isel, who was about to run into him. Issel cheered and disappeared.\n\n‘So far.’\n\nI think I want to make other items as well, but what I have already done is noticeable enough.\n\nI don’t want to be misunderstood by the Master.\n\nEven if I’m an independent being, I’m just a hero anyway.\n\nCritical functions such as summoning and synthesis will not be allowed. Equipment production was impossible without Issel’s help.\n\nI put the crafted weapon in the cart and came out to the arsenal.\n\nJenna looked at the weapon and gaped.\n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“Don’t tell me. I’m hurt.”\n\nTo be precise, I wrote a cheat.\n\nThe same manufacturing method is not allowed for heroes. If you look at the scene where craftsmen, not masters, make equipment, it is not this scam, but an analog method of cutting wood, trimming leather, and melting iron. I was dubious, but glad it was possible.\n\nJenna pulled out a bow from the cart and drew the string.\n\n“An elasticity…”\n\n“An elasticity?”\n\n“It kills me.”\n\nJenna smiled and placed the bow on the shelf.\n\nSubsequently, swords and spear shields were also displayed in the arsenal.\n\n“Isn’t this enough for people who come later to steal it?”\n\nIf you use the ‘exclusive weapon’ function, there will be no such thing.\n\nWhen I came out to the plaza, the armory door slammed shut.\n\nThe sky is a dark gray. It is the same whether it is gray in the morning or evening, but the scenery changes little by little depending on the time of day. For example, light gray in the early morning. Dark gray late at night.\n\n“It’s a potato again when you go back.”\n\n“Are you tired?”\n\n“Of course! Three meals a day: potatoes, potatoes, potatoes! Now, just looking at potatoes makes me vomit.”\n\n[‘Jenna( )’ expresses dissatisfaction with the dorm!]\n\nGradually, I’m starting to feel the limits of my ramen-oriented diet.\n\nWhere do you think you want to change your lodging?\n\n[‘Han( )’ expresses dissatisfaction with the accommodation!]\n\n[Tips/Improve facilities to create a pleasant environment! The hero’s morale increases.]\n\nThat’s it.\n\nThe message just now will be announced in the form of a report when the Master connects. You can ignore it, but then you have to endure it.\n\nAfter parting with Jenna and returning to the room, I looked at the strategy book I had described.\n\nWhere is the wrong part and how to set the direction to proceed. It was going well.\n\nThe next afternoon, Aaron finally learned the low-level spearmanship.\n\nIt’s true that it’s still clumsy, but it’s not to the extent that it’s not bad. I was also able to practice more diversely against humans, out of the way I used to fight only against scarecrows.\n\n“Sah, save me!”\n\n[‘Aaron ( )’ is favored by ‘Han ( )’.]\n\n[Closeness bonus created.]\n\nIs this a pervert?\n\nand the next day.\n\n[Welcome to Pick Me Up!]\n\nThe sky is sparkling white.\n\nI could tell without looking at the message. I closed the notebook with my action goals and got up from my chair. When I came out to the square, Aaron with a nervous face and Jenna with a calm expression were waiting for me.\n\n“Relax.”\n\nI smiled and patted Aaron’s shoulder.\n\nAccording to the Master’s perception, Aaron is on the edge of a cliff, but if he just practices, he can avoid the worst. If it shows minimal activity, it will not be disposed of. Currently, ‘Party 1’ did not even fill the required number of people.\n\n“Come to think of it, there’s no window, but I…!”\n\n“There’s a window.”\n\n“There’s a window.”\n\n[Open the space-time opening!]\n\n[Han Jenna Aaron!]\n\n“I’m going even if I don’t call.”\n\nAre you going to attack with three people?\n\nThat was one way. The difficulty of attacking the tower is not high yet, and at this point, it was obvious that attaching a level 1, 1-star hero would only catch the ankle. I went into the arsenal and took up my sword and shield. Then he threw the spear he had brought to Aaron.\n\n“This….”\n\n“Don’t ask, write it. If it’s a waste of two days of hard work.”\n\n“Thank you!”\n\n“Instead, don’t grab your ankle.”\n\n“I’ll keep that in mind.”\n\n“How long will you be Soso?”\n\n“Then brother!”\n\n“…”\n\nJust by looking at his face, he looks older than me.\n\n“Brother, I’ll do my best!”\n\n“Well, that’s it.”\n\n“It’s good. Let’s do our best together.”\n\nWe entered the gap of space-time. The mirror on the left shone and changed places. A gust of wind blew through the tall trees.\n\n‘It’s a forest.’\n\n[Floor 4.]\n\n[Mission Type – Subjugation]\n\n[Goal – Exterminate the enemy!]\n\n[Goblin Lv.4 X 3]\n\n[Harpy Lv.6 X 2]\n\nAbove the now familiar goblins.\n\nThe lower body of a bird on the upper body of a woman. There is a harpy. As expected, it looks dirty.\n\nThe annoying thing about harpies was that they flew in the sky and attacked mainly from above, which was difficult to deal with.\n\nI told Jenna.\n\n“You take care of that harpy.”\n\n“I thought it would be just like that. I wanted to use the bow I received from my brother properly, but it turned out well.”\n\n“You protect Jenna. The harpies will focus on it.”\n\nMy sword can’t even reach the sky where the harpies are.\n\nAaron, who has a spear with a long reach, was perfect.\n\nI swung the iron sword around.\n\nThe grip was good and the weight was just right. The blade was blinding. It shone so black and blue. Indeed, the weapon I made. It can’t even be compared to the old iron sword. The shield made of pure iron is also shedding a smooth luster. There is no ranged attacker. The goblins armed with\n\nswords and shields, accompanied by harpies, approach us. I came. In this battle, I decided to wait for the goblins to come. It would be nice to go out and fight, but the moment I leave, the formation is broken.\n\nOne of the principles of origin.\n\nThe swordsman fights the enemy within the range of the spear.\n\nAn arrow was shot from Jena’s shortbow. .The\n\narrow stuck into the wing of the harpy on the left.\n\n”\n\nKiaaa!”\n\nThe harpy with the arrow stuck in the\n\nwing rushed at Jenna.\n\n“Aaron ! ”\n\n( )’I feel fear! All stats decrease by 30%.]\n\n“This bastard…”\n\nI stepped forward. A spearhead swept past where I was.\n\nHe was so excited. At least the training ground. Esau didn’t use the spear at random like that.\n\n“Come on!”\n\nJenna slapped Aaron’s cheek hard.\n\nA stream of blood flowed from Aaron’s nose.\n\nThis battle was Aaron’s first real fight. He wasn’t a combatant before. As a spectator, I only watched from the back. I understand. Both Jenna and I went through fear status abnormalities in the first real battle. But Aaron didn’t have a second chance. “If you\n\nfail this time, you die! Is it okay though!”\n\n“…”\n\n“Don’t get carried away.”\n\n“I’ll do it!”\n\nAaron’s spear started to have a direction. The fear didn’t go away, but at least it served as a stumbling block to the harpies who attacked Jenna. After that,\n\nit was a breeze. Aaron and I took a defensive position to protect Jenna, and Jenna shot and killed the harpies and goblins one by one without being checked. [Stage clear!] [‘\n\nAaron\n\n( )’ level up!]\n\n[Reward – 10000G Leather (C) X 3 Iron Ore (C) X 2]\n\n[MVP – ‘Han()’]",
